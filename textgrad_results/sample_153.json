  "question": "Question: What is the correct summary of your trajectory from the beginning to the current location?  \nChoice:  \nA. I start from a high altitude, descend to street level, and move toward the building.  \nB. I start from the street, move along the road, and approach the building from the side of the street.  \nC. I start from a high altitude, move forward and slightly to the right, and descend towards the building entrance.  \nD. I start from the park area, move toward the street, and descend to a position near half the height of the high-rise building.  \nE. I launch from the roof of the building and descend to the ground.

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The trajectory starts from a high altitude, providing a broad view of the urban landscape. As the sequence progresses, the perspective moves forward and slightly to the right, gradually descending towards the building entrance. This is evident from the increasing detail and closer view of the building's structure and surrounding area in the later frames.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 34)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video begins with a wide aerial view, clearly indicating a starting point from a high altitude (0:00-0:01). As the video progresses, the camera moves forward, and the target building, initially on the left side of the frame, gradually shifts towards the center and slightly to the right (e.g., compare 0:00 with 0:10 and 0:20), indicating a movement that is not just straight down but also forward and slightly to the right. Simultaneously, the perspective continuously descends, getting closer to the ground level and the base of the building (evident from the increasing detail of the street, trees, and the building's lower structure from 0:15 onwards). The final frames show the camera at street level, directly in front of what appears to be the building's entrance or a plaza area (0:30-0:34). Therefore, the trajectory is accurately summarized as starting from a high altitude, moving forward and slightly to the right, and descending towards the building entrance. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with this observation.",
