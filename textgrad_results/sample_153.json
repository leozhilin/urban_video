  "question": "Question: What is the correct summary of your trajectory from the beginning to the current location?  \nChoice:  \nA. I start from a high altitude, descend to street level, and move toward the building.  \nB. I start from the street, move along the road, and approach the building from the side of the street.  \nC. I start from a high altitude, move forward and slightly to the right, and descend towards the building entrance.  \nD. I start from the park area, move toward the street, and descend to a position near half the height of the high-rise building.  \nE. I launch from the roof of the building and descend to the ground.

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The trajectory starts from a high altitude, providing a broad view of the urban landscape. As the sequence progresses, the perspective moves forward and slightly to the right, gradually descending towards the building entrance. This is evident from the increasing detail and proximity to the building's structure and surrounding features like roads and green spaces.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 34)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video begins with a wide, high-altitude view of an urban area, clearly showing multiple buildings and roads from above. As the video progresses, the camera continuously descends, moving closer to a specific building. Simultaneously, there is a noticeable horizontal movement that shifts the perspective forward and slightly to the right, aligning the view with the main entrance area of the building. By the end of the video, the camera has reached ground level, providing a detailed view of the building's entrance, the surrounding pavement, and parking spaces. Therefore, the trajectory is accurately summarized as starting from a high altitude, moving forward and slightly to the right, and descending towards the building entrance. The provided answer correctly identifies these key aspects of the trajectory.",
