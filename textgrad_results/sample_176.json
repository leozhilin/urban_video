    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The sequence of images shows the agent navigating through various urban environments, including flying over buildings and crossing water bodies. The final frames depict a view from a high vantage point near a white building, which aligns with the instruction to \"turn back at front of the red board and move fly forward and get up at front of the white building and move forward and get down and stay there.\" This indicates that the agent has reached the point where it needs to turn back in front of the red board, making option D the correct choice.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15), (145, 156)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video shows the agent flying over buildings and a park with a pond. The final frames (0:00-0:15) show the agent flying at a high altitude over buildings. The frames (1:45-1:56) show the agent flying towards a white building and a red structure. This aligns with the instruction to \"turn back at front of the red board and move fly forward and get up at front of the white building and move forward and get down and stay there.\" Therefore, the agent is currently turning back in front of the red board.",
