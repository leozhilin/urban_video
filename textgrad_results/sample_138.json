    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The agent's perspective is from a high altitude, looking directly down at the building and surrounding area, which indicates that the agent is above the \"\u8d1d\u58f3\u751f\u9c9c\" store.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video begins with a high-altitude, top-down perspective of the entire city block, including the building where the \"\u8d1d\u58f3\u751f\u9c9c Food\" store is located (which becomes visible later at 00:51). This initial viewpoint, which sets the scene for the navigation, places the agent (or camera) high above the destination. The provided answer's reasoning accurately describes this initial high-altitude perspective, which is the most fitting interpretation given the provided options and the visual evidence at the start of the video.",
