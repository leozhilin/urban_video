    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The frames show a promenade with benches, lampposts, and trees along the path. These elements are consistent with the description in option A. There are no cars, bicycles, statues, fountains, bridges, or boats visible in the images provided.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 17)]\nOption: A\nReason: The video frames from 0:00 to approximately 0:17 clearly depict a promenade. Along this promenade, several objects are consistently visible: benches (e.g., at 0:00-0:04 on the left), lampposts (e.g., at 0:00, 0:13, 0:15), and trees (e.g., at 0:00, 0:13, 0:15). These observations directly match the items listed in Option A. Options B, C, D, and E include objects that are not present in the video (e.g., cars, traffic lights, bicycles, dogs, playground, statues, fountains, bridge, or boats) or mischaracterize the large body of water as a river. The provided answer correctly identifies the objects and provides accurate reasoning.",
