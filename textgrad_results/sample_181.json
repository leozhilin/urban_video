    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The agent is currently at an elevated position and approaching the target area near the light pole. To land in front of the light pole as instructed, the next logical step is to fly forward while descending to reach the landing spot safely.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:08, 0:11)]\nOption: C\nReason: The navigation instruction given is: \"[take off and turn slightly right and then turn slightly left towards a brown building. fly forward and turn right towards a white building when above an intersection. fly forward and land in front of a light pole.]\".\nBy 0:08, the agent is above an intersection and begins to turn right towards a white building, completing this turn by 0:11. The next part of the instruction is \"fly forward and land in front of a light pole.\" Since the agent is currently at an elevated position (as seen throughout the video, especially at 0:11 looking down at the street level), to \"land\" it must descend. Therefore, the most appropriate next step to fulfill \"fly forward and land\" is to \"fly forward while descending.\" The provided answer correctly identifies this.",
