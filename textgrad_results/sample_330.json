    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The initial frames show a view of tall buildings and a road, but there is no visible stone statue on the left side of any entrance within the field of view. The environment consists mainly of roads, trees, and buildings without any immediate sight of a stone statue.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 3)]\nOption: C\nReason: The initial frames of the video (00:00-00:03) display a first-person perspective of a modern city environment, characterized by tall glass buildings, roads, and green spaces with trees. The question asks if a \"stone statue to the left of the entrance\" is within sight. Upon careful examination of the initial field of view, there is no discernible entrance that would typically feature a stone statue, nor is any stone statue visible anywhere within the frame. The environment is primarily architectural and natural elements. Therefore, the destination is not within sight at the current location. The provided answer is correct.",
