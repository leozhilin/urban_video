    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 50)]\nOption: B\nReason: The question asks about the change in distance *after* the descent from the rooftop. The descent occurs from approximately 0:00 to 0:35. After 0:35, the camera (representing the agent) is at street level and moves forward along the pavement. The line of trees is situated parallel to the pavement. As the agent moves forward along this path, the lateral distance between the agent and the line of trees remains constant. The agent is not moving closer to or further away from the trees; it is moving alongside them. Therefore, the distance remains the same. The provided answer correctly identifies this.",
