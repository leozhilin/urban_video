    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The current location, as indicated by the frames, is behind the Golden Gate Bridge. The sequence of images shows a progression towards and then past the bridge, placing the final position behind it.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(3:34, 5:10)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instructions guide the agent through various parts of the city. The video clearly shows the agent approaching the Golden Gate Bridge between 2:25 and 3:20. Subsequently, the agent flies over the Golden Gate Bridge from approximately 3:20 to 3:34. After crossing the bridge, the agent continues to move forward, turning into a street (3:34-3:40) and then into a park area (4:00-4:15). The final frames of the video (4:15-5:10) show the agent in a park with a pond and a city skyline in the distance, but the Golden Gate Bridge is no longer visible in the forward view. Since the agent has flown over and past the bridge, its current location places the Golden Gate Bridge behind it. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with this observation.",
