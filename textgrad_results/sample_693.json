The distance between me and the fountain remains constant.  ",
  "question_category": "Proximity",
  "ground_truth": "A",
  "textgrad_result": {
    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The sequence of images shows that as the agent rises above the trees, the view transitions from a broader cityscape to a closer view of the park fountain. This indicates that the agent is moving towards the fountain, thus decreasing the distance between itself and the fountain.",
