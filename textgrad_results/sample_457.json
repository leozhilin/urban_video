    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The initial frames show a view of tall residential buildings directly ahead, indicating that the most relevant object in the field of view is a row of tall buildings. There is no visible underground garage, construction site, open space, or parking lot in the middle or right side of the initial view.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 10)]\nOption: D\nReason: At the initial position (0:00-0:10), the field of view is dominated by a prominent row of tall, gray residential buildings directly ahead and to the left. The question asks about navigating to an underground garage near a residential area consisting of gray buildings ahead, making these tall buildings the most relevant object in the field of view. There is no visible underground garage entrance. While there is an undeveloped \"open space\" in the middle, the \"tall buildings\" are more directly indicative of the \"residential area\" mentioned in the prompt. There is no clearly defined construction site or a distinct parking lot as the most relevant object in the initial view. Therefore, option D accurately describes the most relevant object in the initial field of view. The provided answer is correct.",
