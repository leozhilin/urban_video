    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The final instruction directs the agent to stop near the billboard on the roof across the road and lower down a bit. From the provided images, particularly the last few frames, it is evident that the agent's perspective is aligned with being to the left of the rooftop billboard across the street, as the view captures the side of the buildings and the billboard in a lateral alignment. Therefore, option C accurately describes the agent's landmark position relative to the billboard.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(4:25, 4:39)]\nOption: C\nReason: The navigation instructions lead the agent to \"stop near the billboard on the roof across the road and lower down a bit.\" Observing the video from approximately 4:25 to 4:39, the agent approaches and then stops. In the final frames, particularly at 4:39, the rooftop billboard is clearly visible on the building across the road. From the agent's first-person perspective, the billboard is positioned towards the right side of the frame. If the billboard is to the right in the agent's field of view, it implies that the agent's current physical location is to the left of the billboard's central axis. Therefore, the agent is located to the left of the rooftop billboard across the street. The provided answer's reasoning correctly identifies this relative position.",
