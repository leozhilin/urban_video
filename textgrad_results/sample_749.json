  "question": "Question: Which takes longer, your ascent over the trees or your steady approach to the building with a visible rooftop?  \nChoices:  \nA. My ascent over the trees takes longer than my steady approach to the building with a visible rooftop.  \nB. My ascent over the trees and my steady approach to the building take the same time.  \nC. My steady approach to the building with a visible rooftop takes longer than my ascent over the trees.  ",
  "question_category": "Duration",
  "ground_truth": "C",
  "textgrad_result": {
    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The ascent over the trees is depicted in the first four frames, showing a relatively quick transition from ground level to an elevated view. In contrast, the steady approach to the building with a visible rooftop spans from frame five onwards, indicating a longer duration as the agent moves closer to and around the building. Therefore, the steady approach takes longer.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 4), (4, 60)]\nOption: [C]\nReason: The ascent over the trees happens quickly from 0 to 4 seconds. The approach to the building with a visible rooftop starts around 4 seconds and continues until around 60 seconds. Therefore, the approach to the building takes longer.",
