    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The initial position shows a view of tall buildings and the cityscape, but there is no visible balcony on the 13th floor within the field of view. The perspective is too distant and does not provide a close-up view of any specific floor's balcony.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1)]\nOption: C\nReason: The initial frames (00:00-00:01) display a wide, distant view of a cityscape with numerous tall buildings. From this high and distant perspective, it is impossible to discern individual floors or specific features like balconies on any of the buildings. Therefore, the balcony on the 13th floor is not within the field of view at the initial location. The provided answer correctly identifies that the destination is not within sight and provides accurate reasoning.",
