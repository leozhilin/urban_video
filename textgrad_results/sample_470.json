    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 3)]\nOption: E\nReason: From the initial position at 00:00, the agent is looking straight down a wide city street. The question asks to navigate to a \"street light behind a bus stop.\" Bus stops and street lights are typically located along the sides of the road. While the specific bus stop and street light are not explicitly visible in the initial frame, if the target is located to the right of the agent's current forward view (which is a common placement for such urban elements), then the most logical next move to orient towards and begin navigating to this target would be to turn right. The video itself immediately pans to the right from 00:01 to 00:03, revealing more of the right side of the environment, which supports the idea that the area to the right is relevant. Therefore, \"I turn right\" is the most appropriate next move to face the implied target location. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with this analysis.",
