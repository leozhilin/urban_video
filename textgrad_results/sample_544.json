    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"take off and turn little right and move forward till the pond arrives.\" Since the agent is at the initial position on the ground, the best next step is to fly forward while rising to gain altitude, which aligns with the take-off part of the instruction. This prepares the agent to then make the slight right turn and continue towards the pond as directed.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 6)]\nOption: [C]\nReason: The instruction starts with \"take off\", which means the agent needs to rise. The instruction also says \"move forward\", so the agent needs to fly forward. Therefore, the best next step is to fly forward while rising. The provided answer is correct.\n",
