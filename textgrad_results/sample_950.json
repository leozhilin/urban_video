  "question": "Question: At the initial position, you are asked to navigate to the balcony on the 25th floor. When you reach the current location, what is your relative position to the destination?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am currently on the upper right side of the 25th floor of the target building.  \nB. I am currently directly above the target building, at a much higher altitude.  \nC. I am currently on the ground at the front left side of the target building.  \nD. I am currently in the rear left direction of the target building, at the height of the 15th floor.  \nE. I am currently in front of the right side of the target building, at an altitude of 30 floors.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current view shows a high-altitude perspective directly above the target building, indicating that the agent is at a much higher altitude than the 25th floor balcony.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 8)]\nOption: B\nReason: The initial frames of the video (0:00-0:08) clearly show a high-altitude perspective, looking down upon a city with multiple skyscrapers, including the target building which is later identified by its floor numbers. This aerial view indicates that the agent's current position is directly above the target building and at a significantly higher altitude than the 25th floor balcony, which is the stated destination. The subsequent pan down to reveal the floor numbers further confirms that the initial viewpoint was from above the building's highest point. Therefore, the agent is currently directly above the target building, at a much higher altitude.",
