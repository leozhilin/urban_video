    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The video shows a first-person perspective moving through an urban environment. At the initial position, the road is directly in front of the viewer as the movement progresses along the road, passing by buildings and other structures. This indicates that the road is in front of the viewer when they arrive at their current location.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:50, 2:00)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video is captured from an aerial drone perspective, not a ground-level first-person view. However, the question asks about a \"first-person perspective\" and mentions \"movement instructions\" and \"movement progresses along the road.\" Interpreting this in the context of an agent navigating an environment, it implies a hypothetical ground-level agent. If an agent is moving along a road and arrives at their current location on that road, the road would extend directly in front of them. The video clearly shows a long, straight road that an agent could travel along. Therefore, assuming the implied first-person perspective of an agent on the ground, the road is in front.\n\nThe provided answer's option D is correct based on this interpretation. However, its reasoning contains a factual inaccuracy regarding the video's perspective. The statement \"The video shows a first-person perspective moving through an urban environment\" is misleading, as the video is an aerial drone shot. The drone is flying above the environment, not moving along the road from a ground-level first-person viewpoint. The phrase \"as the movement progresses along the road\" describes a hypothetical agent's movement, not the drone's actual movement or camera perspective.",
