    "init_answer": "Option: G; Reason: To navigate to the tables and chairs in front of ALL-STAR Cafe in Central, the agent needs to descend to a level where it can move forward along the sidewalk towards the cafe. Flying forward at the current height would not allow for precise navigation to the specific target location on the ground. Therefore, descending and then flying forward is the appropriate next move.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 25)]\nOption: G\nReason: The video shows the agent's perspective from a high altitude above a city street. The question asks to navigate to the tables and chairs in front of ALL-STAR Cafe in Central. From approximately 00:19 to 00:25, a building with a sign \"CENTRAL ALL-STAR\" is clearly visible on the right side of the street, indicating the target area is on the ground level. Since the agent is currently high above the ground, the immediate and necessary next move to reach a ground-level target is to descend. Once at a suitable height, flying forward will allow the agent to approach the cafe. Therefore, \"descend and fly forward\" is the correct and most logical action. The provided answer correctly identifies this action and provides a sound reason for it.",
