    "init_answer": "Option: G; Reason: To navigate to the tables and chairs in front of ALL-STAR Cafe in Central, the agent needs to descend to a level where it can move forward along the sidewalk towards the cafe. Flying forward at the current height would bypass the target location without reaching the specific area of interest. Therefore, descending and then flying forward is the appropriate next move.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 2)]\nOption: [D]\nReason: From the initial position (0-2s), the agent needs to turn left to face the direction of the ALL-STAR Cafe. Descending and flying forward would not be the most direct route.",
    "feedback": "### 1. Key Disagreements\n\n#### 1.1 Choice of Next Move\n- **Reasoner's Viewpoint**: The reasoner selects option **G (I descend and fly forward)**. The rationale is that descending to a lower altitude allows for precise navigation towards the tables and chairs in front of ALL-STAR Cafe.\n- **Critic's Viewpoint**: The critic selects option **D (I turn left)**. The rationale is that from the initial position, turning left is necessary to face the direction of the ALL-STAR Cafe, making it the most direct route.\n\n#### 1.2 Navigation Strategy\n- **Reasoner's Viewpoint**: The reasoner emphasizes the need to **descend** before moving forward, suggesting that the current altitude is too high to effectively navigate towards the specific target.\n- **Critic's Viewpoint**: The critic focuses on the **directional change** (turning left), implying that the current altitude is appropriate and the primary need is to adjust the heading.\n\n#### 1.3 Initial Position Context\n- **Reasoner's Viewpoint**: There is no explicit mention of the initial position's coordinates or orientation, focusing instead on the general need to descend.\n- **Critic's Viewpoint**: The critic references a specific initial position **(0, 2)** and suggests that this position necessitates a left turn to align with the cafe's direction.\n\n### 2. Required Verifications\n\n#### 2.1 Current Altitude and Orientation\n- **Visual Evidence Needed**: A frame showing the agent's current altitude relative to ground level and its current orientation (which direction it is facing).\n- **Additional Perspectives**: A top-down view of the agent's position relative to the ALL-STAR Cafe and surrounding landmarks.\n- **Verification Purpose**: To determine if the current altitude is indeed too high (supporting the reasoner) or if the primary need is a directional adjustment (supporting the critic).\n\n#### 2.2 Line of Sight to the Target\n- **Visual Evidence Needed**: A frame showing the agent's line of sight towards the ALL-STAR Cafe from the initial position.\n- **Additional Perspectives**: A series of frames showing the view after each potential move (descending, turning left, etc.).\n- **Verification Purpose**: To assess whether descending is necessary to see or reach the target or if turning left directly aligns the agent with the target.\n\n#### 2.3 Initial Position Details\n- **Visual Evidence Needed**: Confirmation of the exact coordinates and orientation at the initial position (0, 2).\n- **Additional Perspectives**: A reference map or grid showing the agent's starting point and the location of the ALL-STAR Cafe.\n- **Verification Purpose**: To validate the critic's claim about the necessity of turning left based on the given initial position.\n\n### 3. Resolution Path\n\n#### 3.1 Step-by-Step Verification\n1. **Altitude Check**: Examine the current altitude using a side-view or altitude meter in the visual data. This will confirm if descending is necessary.\n2. **Orientation Check**: Review the agent's current orientation using a compass overlay or directional indicator. This will validate the need for a left turn.\n3. **Line of Sight Analysis**: Simulate the agent's view after each proposed move (descending, turning left) to see which action better aligns with the target.\n\n#### 3.2 Prioritization of Verifications\n- **Priority 1**: **Orientation Check** - Understanding the agent's current direction is crucial for determining the immediate next move.\n- **Priority 2**: **Altitude Check** - If the orientation supports a left turn, then assessing altitude becomes secondary but still important for precise navigation.\n- **Priority 3**: **Line of Sight Analysis** - This provides a final validation of the chosen move's effectiveness.\n\n#### 3.3 Additional Evidence Needed\n- **Altitude Data**: Numerical altitude readout or a side-view perspective.\n- **Directional Data**: Compass overlay or directional arrow indicating current heading.\n- **View Simulation**: Simulated views after each proposed action to compare outcomes.\n\nBy following this structured analysis and gathering the specified visual evidence, the key disagreements can be systematically resolved, leading to a clear and justified decision on the next move.",
