  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [take off straight up into the air. halfway across the lake, turn slightly to the left and fly over the road. just before the ord intersection, turn slightly towards the last building on the right in that block. at the optician billboard, turn to the left in the direction of 10 oclock and fly forward. fly over 2 blocks of buildings then go lower to the ground in between the and and ord blocks of buildings. land on the far side of the sidewalk. turn to the left in the direction of 9 oclock. fly forward. at the first intersection, stop and look down at the ground. look up at the sky and turn to the right in the direction of 3 oclock. fly over the trees and decrease altitude until reaching the bridge. at the trees, turn to the left in the direction of 7 oclock. fly over the trees and decrease altitude at the fountain. turn to the right in the direction of 3 oclock and fly over the trees and water.]. At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. When you reach the current location, what is your landmark position relative to the bridge?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am on the right side of the bridge.  \nB. I am far away from the bridge.  \nC. I am located above the bridge.  \nD. I am located on the left side of the bridge.  \nE. I am under the bridge.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current location, as depicted in the frames, shows an urban environment with buildings and a park area but no bridge in sight. The instructions mention reaching the bridge after flying over trees and decreasing altitude at the fountain, which suggests that the current position is before this point in the navigation sequence, hence far away from the bridge.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 57)]\nOption: [B]\nReason: The video shows the agent flying over a city with a lake and a park. The instructions state to fly over trees and decrease altitude at the fountain, then turn right and fly over trees and water to reach the bridge. Since the bridge is not yet visible in the current view, the agent is still far away from the bridge. At timestamp 0:57, the bridge becomes visible in the distance.",
