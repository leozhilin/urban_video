  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [taking off and turning left. again turning right and coming down near a building. turning left and going straight. reaching top of the building. turning right and slightly coming down to the sea level. going straight and slight right turn. passing in between buildings and slight right turn and going straight.]. You move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I go up and turn left.  \nB. I go straight and approach a building.  \nC. I fly forward while rising.  \nD. I turn right and descend.  \nE. I rotate the camera downward.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The navigation instruction indicates that after passing between buildings and making a slight right turn, the next step involves going straight. The current view shows an open path towards a building, suggesting that going straight and approaching the building aligns with the given instructions.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 14)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video begins with the agent on top of a building (0:00). The instructions state \"turning right and slightly coming down to the sea level,\" which is visually represented by the camera panning down and right, revealing the street and the sea (0:00-0:08). Following this, the instructions are \"going straight and slight right turn,\" which aligns with the camera continuing to pan right, showing the street and buildings (0:08-0:14). The final instruction given is \"passing in between buildings and slight right turn and going straight.\" At the end of the video (0:14), the view is looking down a street with buildings on the left. This visual context, combined with the last part of the instruction \"going straight,\" strongly suggests that the next logical action is to continue moving straight along the path. Option B, \"I go straight and approach a building,\" directly corresponds to this interpretation, as the path ahead is straight and leads towards the visible buildings. The provided answer's reasoning correctly identifies that the instruction ends with \"going straight\" and that the current view supports this action towards buildings.",
