    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: Based on the navigation instruction and the current visual context, the next step involves moving forward while rising. This aligns with the part of the instruction that says \"move forward and go over the top of the buildings,\" indicating an upward and forward motion to navigate over the structures ahead.",
