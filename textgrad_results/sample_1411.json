  "question": "Question: Which one takes longer for you to turn and focus on the high-rise buildings or for you to move forward and reach the target rooftop?  \nChoices:  \nA. I take longer to turn and focus on the tall buildings than to reach the target rooftop.  \nB. I take the same amount of time to turn and focus on the tall buildings as to reach the target rooftop.  \nC. I take less time to turn and focus on the tall buildings than to reach the target rooftop.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The sequence of images shows that the agent quickly turns and focuses on the high-rise buildings, which happens in just a few frames. In contrast, moving forward to reach the target rooftop involves traversing a significant distance, which takes up a larger portion of the frames. Therefore, it takes less time to turn and focus on the tall buildings than to reach the target rooftop.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 14), (14, 134)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video shows the agent turning and focusing on the high-rise buildings from approximately 0:04 to 0:14, which takes about 10 seconds. Subsequently, the agent moves forward and ascends towards the target rooftop (the prominent high-rise building) from 0:14 until the end of the video at 1:34. This forward movement and ascent takes approximately 1 minute and 20 seconds (80 seconds). Comparing the two durations, 10 seconds for turning is significantly less than 80 seconds for moving forward and reaching the target rooftop. Therefore, it takes less time to turn and focus on the tall buildings than to reach the target rooftop. The provided answer's option and overall reasoning are correct.",
