    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The current view suggests that the agent is at a high vantage point overlooking the buildings. According to the navigation instruction, the next step involves getting down to the chairs between the buildings and staying there. To achieve this, the agent needs to first locate these chairs, which likely requires a downward view to identify their exact position amidst the buildings. Therefore, rotating the camera downward is the best next step to spot the chairs and plan the descent accurately.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(5:00, 7:46)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instruction states \"now fly over the buildings and get down to the chairs between the buildings and stay there.\" At the end of the video (from approximately 5:00 onwards), the agent is at a high altitude, flying over the city with a wide view of the buildings and the distant horizon. From this high vantage point, the \"chairs between the buildings\" are not visible. To successfully \"get down to the chairs,\" the agent first needs to locate them. Rotating the camera downward would allow the agent to survey the ground and the spaces between the buildings, which is essential for identifying the target chairs and planning the precise descent. Therefore, rotating the camera downward is the most logical and necessary immediate next step. The provided answer's reasoning is correct.",
