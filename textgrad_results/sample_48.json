    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The current perspective shows that the agent is at the height of the middle floor and is close to the side facade of the target building, which matches the description in option E.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 32)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video starts with an aerial view and then descends, moving the agent's perspective. From approximately 0:25 to 0:32, the agent's viewpoint is clearly elevated, positioned between two tall buildings. The building on the right (from the agent's perspective) is the target building. The view shows the agent is at a height corresponding to the middle floors of these tall buildings, and is very close to the side of the building, looking along its facade. This perfectly matches the description in option E: \"I am currently close to the side facade of the middle floor area of the target building and am at the height of the middle floor.\"\n\nThe provided answer's reason is correct and aligns with my analysis.",
