  "textgrad_result": {
    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The initial frames show a high-altitude view of a cityscape with no visible signs or specific buildings that can be identified as the \"Jiuyuan Tobacco and Liquor Shop\" or the entrance to a residential community. The detailed shop sign is not within sight from this perspective.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1:42)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video begins with a high-altitude, abstract view of a city, where buildings are represented as simple blocks and no specific details such as shop signs or community entrances are discernible. From this initial perspective, it is impossible to identify the \"Jiuyuan Tobacco and Liquor Shop\" or the entrance to a residential community. The camera only descends to street level much later in the video (around 2:26), and even then, the specific shop \"Jiuyuan Tobacco and Liquor Shop\" is not visible among the various shop signs shown. Therefore, at the initial position, the destination is not within sight. The provided answer correctly identifies that the initial frames do not show the required details.",
