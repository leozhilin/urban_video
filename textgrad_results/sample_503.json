    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The initial frames show a view of a residential area with buildings, trees, and parked cars, but there is no red car visible at the edge of the residential area in the field of view. The frames focus on different parts of the environment, including a parking lot and a fountain, but the specific destination (a red car) is not within sight.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 10), (11, 47)]\nOption: [C]\nReason: From the initial position (0-10s), the view is blocked by buildings.
