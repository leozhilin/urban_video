    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The agent's perspective indicates a high vantage point overlooking the community, suggesting it is much higher than the surrounding buildings and northwest of the underground parking entrance.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 5)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video begins with a wide aerial shot (0:00-0:05), clearly showing the agent's perspective from a very high altitude, significantly above all surrounding buildings. The underground parking entrance, identifiable as the dark rectangular opening between the two tall buildings, is visible in the lower-middle section of this initial view. From this high vantage point, the agent's position is to the northwest of the underground parking entrance. Therefore, option C accurately describes both the agent's height and their direction relative to the community entrance (underground parking lot). The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with the visual evidence.",
