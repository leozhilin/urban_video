At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I fly forward, then turn left.  \nB. I drop down and turn right.  \nC. I fly forward while rising.  \nD. I turn left and descend.  \nE. I rotate the camera downward.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"take off and look at the sea,\" which implies that the agent should start by flying forward while rising to get a view of the sea. This matches option C, which suggests flying forward while rising.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 7)]\nOption: C\nReason: The initial instruction is \"take off and look at the sea\". At the starting point (0:00), the agent is on a platform overlooking the sea, with a railing obstructing part of the view. To \"take off\" implies gaining altitude (rising). To \"look at the sea\" effectively from this position, the agent would need to rise to clear the railing and get a better vantage point. The video frames from 0:00 to 0:07 show the camera rising and the view shifting upwards, revealing more of the sea and less of the platform, which aligns with \"flying forward while rising\" to achieve the goal of \"looking at the sea\" after taking off. The provided answer is correct.",
