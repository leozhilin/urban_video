    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The initial frames show a view from a high vantage point overlooking a cityscape with buildings, roads, and vehicles. There is no visible seller's store or bus stop in the immediate field of view. The camera moves to focus on a specific building with advertisements but does not show a seller's store behind a bus stop. Therefore, the destination is not within sight at the current location.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 7)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video begins with a high aerial view of a city, primarily showing the tops and sides of tall residential buildings and a distant hazy cityscape. From this initial vantage point, neither a bus stop nor any specific seller's store behind one is visible. The camera's perspective is too high and broad to discern such ground-level details. The bus stop and the seller's stores only become visible much later in the video (starting around 2:00 for the bus stop and 2:40 for the stores) after the camera has significantly descended and changed its angle to an overhead view of the street. Therefore, at the initial position, the destination is not within sight. The provided answer is correct.",
