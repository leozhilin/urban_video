    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 3)]\nOption: D\nReason: At the initial position (00:00-00:03), the camera is looking forward down a street between tall buildings. The stone statue to the left of the entrance, which is later revealed to be in a plaza area below and to the right of the initial view (visible clearly from 00:37 onwards), is not within the field of view at the starting point. The camera needs to pan significantly to reveal this area.",
