  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [take off and rise up to the top of the buildings. go right through the column of buildings. go straight and toward the red and green trees. go across the water and stop at the edge where the trees are. take a left turn toward the buildings. go straight toward the tall building and rise to the top of that building.]. At the initial position, you are asked to follow a series of movement instructions. What is the Landmark Position between you and the tall building when you reach the current location?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am on the left side of the tall building.  \nB. I am far away from high-rise buildings.  \nC. I am located above a tall building.  \nD. I am on the right side of the tall building.  \nE. I am located under a tall building.  ",

  "textgrad_result": {
    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The current location shows a view from above the tall building, as indicated by the perspective looking down at the surrounding structures and rooftops. This aligns with the final instruction to \"rise to the top of that building,\" confirming that the agent is now positioned above the tall building.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(04:30, 05:59)]\nOption: C\nReason: The navigation instructions explicitly state \"go straight toward the tall building and rise to the top of that building.\" The video segment from 04:30 onwards shows the agent ascending the tall building and then providing a panoramic view from its summit, looking down at the surrounding city and other buildings. This visual evidence directly confirms that the agent has reached the top of the tall building, meaning the agent is located above it. The provided answer's reasoning is correct and aligns with the visual information and the given instructions.",
