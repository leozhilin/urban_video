  "question": "Question: When you continue to move through the intersection, how does the distance between you and the advertising high-rise building change?  \nChoice: A. Increase the distance between me and high-rise buildings.  \n            B. The distance between me and the high-rise building remains unchanged.  \n            C. The distance between me and high-rise buildings decreases.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: As the agent moves through the intersection, the high-rise building becomes more prominent and detailed in the frames, indicating a decrease in distance between the agent and the building. The building's features become clearer and larger in the visual field, suggesting that the agent is getting closer to it.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:25, 0:40)]\nOption: C\nReason: As the agent moves forward from approximately 0:25, transitioning from a park-like setting to a street (implying movement through an intersection), the advertising high-rise building on the right side of the frame continuously increases in apparent size and its architectural details become significantly clearer. This visual evidence directly indicates that the distance between the agent and the high-rise building is decreasing. The provided answer's reasoning is accurate and aligns with this observation.",
