  "question": "Question: If you choose to fly over two buildings, can you reach the window of the second-highest side terrace of a high-rise building close to the sea?  \nChoice: A. I can complete the mission because I avoid potential collisions and can see the target.  \n           B. I will not be able to complete the task due to the need to adjust my height, which is inefficient.  \n           C. I can accomplish the mission because the high-altitude view facilitates precise targeting of the terrace.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The high-altitude view provides a clear and unobstructed line of sight to the target building, making it easier to precisely locate and reach the second-highest side terrace. This vantage point minimizes the risk of collision with other structures and allows for accurate navigation towards the destination.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 200)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video demonstrates the agent's ability to ascend and fly over multiple buildings (0:00-0:40), effectively avoiding potential collisions with lower structures. From this high-altitude vantage point, the target high-rise building close to the sea becomes clearly visible (0:40-1:20). The subsequent flight path and precise approach to a specific side terrace and its window (1:59-2:00) confirm that the high-altitude view facilitates accurate navigation and precise targeting. Therefore, the mission can be accomplished because the elevated perspective provides an unobstructed line of sight, making it easier to locate and reach the desired terrace window.",
