    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"take off and turn back and move forward,\" which implies the first action should be to ascend (fly up) and then proceed with other movements. Among the given options, \"I fly forward when rising\" aligns best with this initial step of taking off and moving forward.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 7)]\nOption: C\nReason: The instruction starts with \"take off and turn back and move forward\". The video starts with a view of the horizon. Therefore, the first step is to take off, which means rising, and then move forward. Option C, \"I fly forward when rising,\" best describes this initial action.",
