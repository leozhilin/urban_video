  "question": "Question: Which of the following choices better summarizes your movement route?  \nChoices:  \nA. I go from the rooftop with antennas to the buildings on the right by ascending and then descending towards the road.  \nB. I go from the road leading towards the city to the fourth-floor window by making a semicircular path around the park.  \nC. I go from the rooftop with antennas to the targeted fourth-floor window by flying forward while gradually descending along the road aligned with trees.  \nD. I go from the path along the edge of the park to the rooftop with antennas by flying in a straight trajectory.  \nE. I go from the road with tall buildings on the right to the targeted fourth-floor window by turning sharply to the left.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The sequence of images shows a movement starting from a rooftop with antennas, then flying forward over a road aligned with trees, and gradually descending towards a targeted fourth-floor window. This matches the description in option C.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 124)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video begins with a view from a rooftop that clearly shows antennas (0:00-0:03). The camera then moves forward, gradually descending, with a long road aligned with trees visible to the left of the flight path (0:05-1:10). As the camera continues to fly forward and descend, it approaches a building on the right side of the road, eventually entering a window that appears to be on the fourth floor (1:20-1:24). This entire trajectory is accurately summarized by option C. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with the visual evidence.",
