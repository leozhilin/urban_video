    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 0)]\nOption: C\nReason: At the initial position (0:00), the video shows an aerial view directly above a swimming pool area within the residential complex. The camera is looking straight down. The \"outer edge of the residential area,\" which is later revealed to be a large road and a river/canal (visible from approximately 0:28 onwards as the camera pans out), is not within the field of view at the very beginning of the video. Therefore, the destination is not within sight at the current location. The provided answer is correct.",
