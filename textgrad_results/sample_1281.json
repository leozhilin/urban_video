    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The sequence of images shows a transition from being on top of a building to approaching and then crossing over a body of water, which aligns with the instruction \"to move forward to see the pool shines by sunlight and cross the pool to reach the street.\" The current view indicates that the agent is in the process of crossing the water.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:25, 2:05)]\nOption: A\nReason: The navigation instruction states: \"to move forward to see the pool shines by sunlight and cross the pool to reach the street.\" In the video, from approximately 1:00, the agent's view shifts to a large body of water (a pool or lake) reflecting sunlight. From 1:25 onwards, the agent is clearly positioned over this body of water and is moving across it. Therefore, the agent is currently in the process of crossing the water, which directly aligns with option A and the given instruction. The provided answer correctly identifies the current action and the corresponding part of the navigation instruction.",
