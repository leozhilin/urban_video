  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [step rise up until the two building appears. go towards the building crossing over pond. go decent down slightly and take round turn. head towards twin building and take right turn near the right building. take round turn above billboard cross the pond once again. head towards the intersection and take left turn near the grey building. cross over the intersection and head towards the second tall building on left. go beside that building and land in front of billboard.]. At the initial position, you are asked to navigate according to a series of movement instructions. When you reach your current location, what is your Landmark Position from the billboard?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am to the left of the billboard.  \nB. I am located underneath the billboard.  \nC. I am to the right of the billboard.  \nD. I am positioned above the billboard.  \nE. I am far away from the billboard.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The final frames show the agent approaching and then being directly in front of a billboard, which suggests that the agent has landed at a position that is underneath the billboard. This aligns with the navigation instructions to \"land in front of billboard,\" indicating the agent's final position is directly below it.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(2:07, 2:14)]\nOption: B\nReason: The navigation instruction explicitly states to \"land in front of billboard\" as the final step. In the video, from approximately 2:07 onwards, a billboard becomes clearly visible on top of a building on the right side of the street. The agent then descends and lands at street level, directly facing this billboard. Given that the billboard is elevated on a building and the agent is on the ground directly below it, the agent's position is accurately described as \"underneath the billboard.\" The provided answer correctly identifies this relationship and aligns with the visual evidence and the instruction.",
