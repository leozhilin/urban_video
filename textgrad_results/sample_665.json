    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The current view shows that the agent is at a height slightly above the 12th floor, as indicated by the visible floor numbers on the building. Additionally, there is some horizontal distance from the balcony, suggesting that the agent is not directly above or below but rather at a slight elevation and distance from the target balcony.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 53), (54, 126)]\nOption: [E]\nReason: From the video, especially between 0:54 and 1:26, we can see the building with floor numbers clearly marked.
