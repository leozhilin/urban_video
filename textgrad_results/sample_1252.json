  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [rise, turn to the right and fly to the center of the lake. turn slightly to the left and fly to the building across from the 'instant coffee' billboard. turn to the right and fly to the tall stone building with the half oval windows. turn to the left and fly to the intersection with the blue mailbox by the park.]. You move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I go up and turn right.  \nB. I descend and then fly forward.  \nC. I fly forward while rising.  \nD. I turn left and descend.  \nE. I rotate the camera upward and fly forward.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The current view shows a clear path forward with no immediate obstacles, suggesting that flying forward while rising is the most logical next step to continue navigating towards the tall stone building with half oval windows as per the instructions.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:55, 2:19)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video from 1:55 to 2:19 shows the agent flying forward at a high altitude, looking down a street with numerous buildings. A very tall building is visible in the distance (starting around 2:00), which is likely the \"tall stone building with the half oval windows\" mentioned in the third navigation instruction. The agent appears to be already oriented towards this building, as it is directly in the forward path. Therefore, the most logical next step is to continue flying forward to reach this target. While the agent is already at a significant altitude and not visibly *actively* rising in the very last seconds of the video, \"rising\" could be a continuous or intermittent action required to navigate over city buildings or to approach a tall structure, making \"fly forward while rising\" a plausible overall action for reaching the next tall building target. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with this interpretation, highlighting a \"clear path forward\" and the continuation of navigation towards the specified tall building. The \"turn to the right\" part of the third instruction is not explicitly observed in the final segment, suggesting it may have already occurred or is a minor adjustment not yet shown, and the primary action is forward movement.",
