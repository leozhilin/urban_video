    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The images show a top-down view of a U-shaped arrangement of high-rise buildings with a central courtyard. This matches the description in option E, where three high-rise buildings form a U-shape with a central courtyard below, and the agent is positioned above this courtyard.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 20)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video shows a top-down perspective of an urban environment. From approximately 0:07 onwards, it becomes clear that there are three prominent high-rise buildings. Two are on either side of the view, running parallel, and a third high-rise building is visible at the bottom of the frame, connecting the two side buildings and forming a distinct U-shape. The area directly below the agent's viewpoint, enclosed by these three buildings, is a central courtyard or plaza containing green spaces, roads, and smaller structures. The agent's position is directly above this courtyard, looking down. This perfectly matches the description in Option E. The provided answer is consistent with this analysis.",
