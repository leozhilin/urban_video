  "question": "Question: Where are the starting and ending points of your journey?  \nOptions:  \nA. I start above a city street and end at the buildings along the street.  \nB. I start above a city street and end in the center of the street.  \nC. I start above the store and end by hovering at the target window.  \nD. I start in the center of a city intersection and end near a unique building with grid-like windows at another intersection.  \nE. I start above mid-floor level and end exactly aligned with the center of the window.",

  "textgrad_result": {
    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The journey begins at a city intersection with multiple buildings and streets visible, and it ends near a unique building with grid-like windows at another intersection, as indicated by the changing perspectives and final focus on a specific building's facade.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 5), (1:09, 1:17)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video begins at street level, showing a wide view of a city street with buildings on either side and what appears to be an intersection ahead (0:00-0:05). This aligns with \"start in the center of a city intersection.\" The journey then involves the camera ascending and moving through the cityscape. Towards the end of the video, the camera is positioned high up, directly facing a tall building with a prominent grid-like pattern of windows (1:09-1:17). The surrounding view still shows other city buildings and streets, indicating it's at another location within the city, consistent with \"end near a unique building with grid-like windows at another intersection.\" The provided answer correctly identifies the starting and ending points based on the visual evidence.",
