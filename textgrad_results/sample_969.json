    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The sequence of images shows that the agent has already passed the car wash building, crossed the bridge, and flown over the trees. It then moved along the road towards the white tower and is now near white buildings, slowing down and looking around, which matches the final part of the navigation instruction.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 22), (133, 156), (404, 408)]\nOption: [C]\nReason: The video shows the agent flying towards a building with a \"Dave's Car Wash\" sign (0:20-0:22). Later, the agent is seen flying along a road with buildings on either side (1:33-1:56). Finally, the agent is seen near some white buildings, slowing down and looking around (4:04-4:08). This matches the instruction \"move forward to the white buildings slow down and look around the buildings and stay there.\" Therefore, the correct answer is C.",
