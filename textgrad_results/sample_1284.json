    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The initial position shows a view of tall buildings and a cityscape, but there is no visible balcony on the 15th floor within the current field of view. The perspective is too distant and does not provide a close-up view of any specific floor's balcony.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1)]\nOption: D\nReason: At the initial position (00:00-00:01), the video shows a wide view of a cityscape with several tall buildings. The perspective is from a high vantage point, looking across the city. While there are buildings, it is impossible to identify individual floors or specific features like a 15th-floor balcony from this distance and angle. The camera later pans down and zooms in on a building, revealing floor numbers, but this is not the \"initial position.\" Therefore, the 15th-floor balcony is not within sight at the initial location. The provided answer is correct.",
