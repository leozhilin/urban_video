  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [take off and turn slightly right and then turn slightly left towards a brown building. fly forward and turn right towards a white building when above an intersection. fly forward and land in front of a light pole.]. You move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I go up and turn right.  \nB. I fly forward.  \nC. I fly forward while descending.  \nD. I turn left and go up.  \nE. I rotate my camera upward and fly forward.",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The navigation instruction specifies to \"fly forward and land in front of a light pole.\" Given the current position, which is above an intersection with a clear view of the street and light poles ahead, the best next step is to fly forward while descending to prepare for landing in front of a light pole. This aligns with the final part of the navigation instruction.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 17)]\nOption: C\nReason: The navigation instruction is \"[take off and turn slightly right and then turn slightly left towards a brown building. fly forward and turn right towards a white building when above an intersection. fly forward and land in front of a light pole.]\".\nFrom the video, especially from 0:12 onwards, the agent appears to be above an intersection, with a large white building visible to the right (which was the target for the previous step). The view is now looking down a street with multiple light poles visible along it. The remaining instruction is \"fly forward and land in front of a light pole.\" To \"land,\" the agent must descend. Therefore, \"fly forward while descending\" is the most appropriate next step to fulfill the instruction of flying forward and landing.\n\nThe provided answer is correct and aligns with my analysis.",
