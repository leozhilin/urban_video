    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The navigation instruction specifies to \"fly forward and land in front of a light pole.\" Given the current position, which is above an intersection with a clear view of the street ahead, the best next step is to fly forward while descending to prepare for landing near the light pole as instructed. Option C aligns with this requirement by indicating a forward movement combined with descent.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 17)]\nOption: [C]\nReason: The instruction is to \"fly forward and land in front of a light pole\" after turning right towards a white building when above an intersection. The video shows the agent is above an intersection and has turned towards the white building. The next step is to fly forward and descend to land in front of a light pole. Therefore, option C is the best next step.\n",
