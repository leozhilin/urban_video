    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 17)]\nOption: B\nReason: The navigation instruction states: \"[take off and turn slightly right and then turn slightly left towards a brown building. fly forward and turn right towards a white building when above an intersection. fly forward and land in front of a light pole.]\".\nAnalyzing the video:\n- From 0:00 to 0:09, the agent takes off, turns slightly right, and then turns slightly left, aligning with the street towards a brown building in the distance.\n- From 0:09 to 0:11, the agent flies forward.\n- From 0:11 to 0:14, the agent is above an intersection and turns right towards the tall white building visible on the right side of the screen.\n- At 0:14, the agent has completed the turn towards the white building. The current view (0:14-0:17) shows the white building ahead and slightly to the right, with the street leading towards it.\nAccording to the navigation instruction, after turning right towards the white building, the next step is \"fly forward\" to \"land in front of a light pole.\" Therefore, the best next step is to fly forward. The provided answer correctly identifies this.",
