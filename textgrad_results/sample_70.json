    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The final frames show a stable position in front of a building, indicating that the agent has completed its navigation instructions and is now staying in front of the building as described in the last part of the navigation instruction.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(4:30, 6:59)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instruction concludes with \"and stay at front of the building.\" The video frames from approximately 4:30 onwards show the agent's perspective stabilizing in front of a building, with the camera focused on its facade and no further movement observed. This directly corresponds to the final instruction to \"stay at front of the building,\" indicating that the agent has completed its sequence of movements and is now in a stationary position as instructed. The provided answer correctly identifies this final state.",
