    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The sequence of images shows a progression from viewing the light gray building and its surroundings to gradually revealing more of the environment, including a school track and field and a red building in the distance. This suggests that the next logical move would be to continue moving forward and turning left to further explore and reveal these elements.",

From 0:35 to 0:60, the video shows the school track and field and a red building in the distance. Therefore, the next move is to move forward to re-approach the light gray building and turn to the left, revealing the school track and field and a red building in the distance.",
