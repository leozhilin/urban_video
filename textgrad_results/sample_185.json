If I choose to hover around the building, I can complete the task because I avoid obstacles, and the hypothetical movement takes shorter time.  \nB. If I choose to hover around the building, I can complete the task because I acquire a better vantage point, but the alternative takes longer time.  \nC.

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: Hovering around the cylindrical building does not provide a path to reach the balcony on the 13th floor, as the task specifically requires descending towards it. The balcony is only accessible by moving directly towards and descending to the specified floor.",
