    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current perspective shows that the agent is directly above the small two-story house with a blue roof, as indicated by the central positioning of the house in the view and the absence of any significant distance or angle suggesting a different direction.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 124)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video starts with a wide aerial view and gradually zooms in and descends. From approximately 0:50 onwards, a small two-story house with a blue roof becomes clearly visible and is the primary focus. By the end of the video (around 1:00-1:24), the camera's perspective is directly overhead, with the blue-roofed house centered in the frame, indicating that the agent's current location is directly above the house. The provided answer correctly identifies this.",
