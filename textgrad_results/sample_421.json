At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. When you reach your current location, what is your Landmark Position from the gray building?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am to the left of the gray building.  \nB. I am above the gray building.  \nC. I am far away from the gray building.  \nD. I am to the right of the gray building.  \nE. I am located underneath the gray building.  ",

    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:30, 1:46)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instructions explicitly state, \"now get little down and turn back and go forward until the grey building arrives and stay there.\" The video frames from 1:30 onwards show the agent approaching a prominent grey building on the left side of the screen. By 1:40, the agent's perspective is extremely close to the lower part of this grey building, looking up at its windows and facade. This visual evidence, combined with the instruction to \"stay there\" at the grey building, indicates that the agent has reached the base or ground level of the building. Therefore, being \"located underneath\" the grey building is the most accurate description of the agent's final landmark position. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with this analysis.",
