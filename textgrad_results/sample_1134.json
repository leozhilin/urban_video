However, there are multiple red billboards and signs visible in the images, suggesting that another red billboard is likely located close to the mentioned shop. This is inferred from the consistent theme of red signage in the area.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(02:20, 02:22)]\nOption: D\nReason: The shop with the red sign displaying \"\u65b9\u65b9\u8170\u82b1\u725b\u8089\u9762\" is clearly visible in frames 02:20-02:22. Immediately to its left (from the viewer's perspective), there is another shop with a prominent red sign that reads \"\u548c\u5584\u56ed\". This directly matches option D, \"Another red billboard near the shop with the red sign.\" The provided answer's reason is incorrect in stating that the shop is not directly visible and that the presence of another red billboard is merely inferred; it is directly observable.",
