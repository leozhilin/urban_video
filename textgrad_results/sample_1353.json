    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The agent is currently positioned over a cluster of buildings and needs to navigate towards the nearby green delivery locker. Given the layout, turning right will align the agent's path with the direction of the green delivery locker, which appears to be located further along the road to the right. This maneuver helps in efficiently approaching the target destination.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 25), (25, 30)]\nOption: E\nReason: At the initial position (0:00-0:25), the agent is positioned over a running track. The question asks for the next step to navigate to a nearby green delivery locker, \"Given what's next for [tall buildings]\". From approximately 0:25, the camera begins to pan and turn to the right, revealing a complex of tall buildings. This movement suggests that the tall buildings are a significant landmark or are in the direction of the target. Therefore, turning right is the logical next step to orient the agent towards the area where the green delivery locker is implied to be located, near or beyond these tall buildings. The provided answer incorrectly states the agent is \"currently positioned over a cluster of buildings\" at the initial position; the initial view is of a running track. However, the chosen action \"E. I turn right\" is consistent with the visual evidence of the camera's movement to reveal the relevant landmarks (tall buildings) that are \"next\".",
