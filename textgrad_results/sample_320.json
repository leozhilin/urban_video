    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The trajectory starts from the left side of a building with a distinctive conical dome, then turns right, descends to a certain height, and moves forward to approach the balcony on the 11th floor. This matches the visual sequence where the agent initially views the building from a higher vantage point and gradually approaches the specific floor level.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 57)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video starts from a high vantage point, showing a building with a conical dome. The camera then moves down and to the right, approaching the target building. The floors are numbered, and the camera moves towards the 11th floor. Therefore, the trajectory starts from the left side of the building with a huge conical dome, turns right, descends to a certain height, and moves forward to approach the balcony on the 11th floor.",
