After that, it turns left and moves towards a red rocket building. Then, it turns right and moves towards a pond, and finally turns left and moves forward to a road. The final frames show the agent on the road, far away from the pond. Therefore, the landmark position from the pond when the agent reaches the current location is far away from the pond. The provided answer is correct.\n",
