  "question": "```\n\u201c\u201c\u201c\nQuestion: You are moving following a series of movement instructions: \"Rotate 180 degrees backwards. Fly forward while keeping the camera gimbal angle downward. When seeing a T-shaped intersection, adjust the camera pan tilt angle upwards to observe the surrounding environment. Finally, gradually descend to the vicinity of the T-shaped intersection.\" What is the positional relationship between you and the T-shaped intersection when it reached current position?\nChoices:\nA. I am located to the left of the T-shaped intersection.\nB. I am located far away from the T-shaped intersection.\nC. I am located above the T-shaped intersection.\nD. I am located to the right of the T-shaped intersection.\nE. I am located below the T-shaped intersection.\n\n\u201d\u201d\u201d\n```\n",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The agent's perspective shows an aerial view directly above the T-shaped intersection, indicating that the agent is located above it.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 56)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video shows an aerial perspective throughout. The agent flies forward, and a T-shaped intersection formed by water channels and paths becomes visible below. The instructions state that the agent will \"gradually descend to the vicinity of the T-shaped intersection.\" At the \"current position\" (the end of the video), the agent is still high above the T-shaped intersection, looking directly down at it, providing a clear overhead view of the entire area. This indicates that the agent is located above the T-shaped intersection. The provided answer is correct.",
