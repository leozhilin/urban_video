  "question": "Question: At the starting position, you are asked to navigate to a small two-story house with a blue roof in the community below. What is the correct summary of your trajectory from start to current position?  \nChoice:  \nA. Start from a high-rise building, descend to street level, and move toward a small house.  \nB. I start from the middle of the road, fly over several buildings, and approach the small house from the east.  \nC. Start from a high altitude and fly to the left, passing several high-rise buildings.  \nD. I start from above the high-rise building, descend to street level, move along the street, and approach the small house from the west.  \nE. Start from a high-rise building, descend and fly over the street, parking lot, and part of the green space to reach the current position above the small house.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The trajectory starts from a high altitude, as indicated by the initial wide view of the cityscape. The agent then descends and flies over various features such as streets, a parking lot, and green spaces, eventually reaching a position above the small house. This matches the description in option E.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 41)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video begins with a wide, high-altitude view of a cityscape, indicating the agent starts from a high position, likely above or near high-rise buildings. As the video progresses, the camera steadily descends and moves forward. During this descent, various urban features such as streets, parking lots, and green spaces within the community are clearly visible passing underneath the agent. By the end of the video, the agent has descended significantly and is positioned directly above a smaller, two-story building, which aligns with the description of a \"small house.\" Therefore, option E accurately summarizes the trajectory: starting from a high-rise building (or high altitude above them), descending, and flying over streets, parking lots, and green spaces to reach a position above the small house. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with this observation.",
