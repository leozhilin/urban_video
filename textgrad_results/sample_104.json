  "question": "Question: At the starting position, you are asked to navigate to a small two-story house with a blue roof in the community below. What is the correct summary of your trajectory from start to current position?  \nChoice:  \nA. Start from a high-rise building, descend to street level, and move toward a small house.  \nB. I start from the middle of the road, fly over several buildings, and approach the small house from the east.  \nC. Start from a high altitude and fly to the left, passing several high-rise buildings.  \nD. I start from above the high-rise building, descend to street level, move along the street, and approach the small house from the west.  \nE. Start from a high-rise building, descend and fly over the street, parking lot, and part of the green space to reach the current position above the small house.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The trajectory starts from a high altitude, as indicated by the initial wide view of the cityscape. The agent then descends and flies over various features such as streets, a parking lot, and green spaces, aligning with the detailed views of these areas in subsequent frames. The final position is above a small house, which matches the endpoint described in option E.",
    "evaluation": "Let's analyze the video and the provided answer.\n\nLocation: [(0, 41)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video starts with a high-altitude view of the cityscape, confirming the \"start from a high altitude\" part of option E. As the video progresses, the camera descends, showing streets, parking lots, and green spaces, which aligns with \"descend and fly over the street, parking lot, and part of the green space.\" While the video doesn't explicitly show the final position above the small house, the trajectory described in option E is the most accurate representation of the observed movement. Therefore, option E is the correct answer. The provided answer is correct.\n",
