    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The sequence of images shows the agent initially moving forward and then gradually turning to the left, as indicated by the changing perspective of the buildings and the street. This suggests that the first action taken is to turn slightly to the left.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 5)]\nOption: A\nReason: The video begins with a static view of the cityscape. From approximately 0:01 onwards, the camera's perspective clearly shifts to the left. The building initially on the left side of the frame at 0:00 becomes more prominent and then is gradually moved past as the agent turns. This continuous change in the horizontal angle of view, particularly relative to the buildings, indicates that the first action is a turn to the left. The provided answer correctly identifies this initial action and provides a valid reason.",
