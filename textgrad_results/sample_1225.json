Given the center of the open space at the front entrance to the building, what\u2019s your next move?  \nchoose:  \nA. I rise.  \nB. I rotate the camera downward.  \nC. I fly forward.  \nD. I turn left.  \nE. I turn right.  \nF. I rotate the camera upward.  \nG. I descend.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The agent is currently at a high vantage point overlooking the open space at the front entrance of the building. To navigate towards this open space effectively, the most logical next move is to fly forward, as this will allow the agent to cover the distance directly and efficiently reach the target area. Other options like turning or rotating the camera do not contribute to moving towards the destination.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 33)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video shows the agent starting from a high vantage point, and the camera then rotates downwards to clearly show the open space at the front entrance of the building. This indicates that the agent is currently positioned above and somewhat horizontally displaced from the target open space. To \"navigate to an open space at the front entrance,\" the agent needs to move both downwards and forwards. \"Fly forward\" in this context, especially with the camera looking down at the target, implies moving along the current gaze direction, which would effectively move the agent both horizontally and vertically towards the open space. This is the most direct and efficient action to reach the destination from the current high, distant perspective. Other options like turning or rotating the camera do not involve movement towards the destination, and \"descend\" alone might not cover the necessary horizontal distance. The provided answer's reasoning is correct.",
