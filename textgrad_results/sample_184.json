    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The final part of the navigation instruction states to \"stop near the billboard on the roof across the road and lower down a bit.\" The current image shows a view from above, looking towards a building with a visible billboard on its roof, which aligns with this final step in the instructions. Therefore, the agent is now stopping near the billboard and lowering itself a little further.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:35, 0:47), (3:53, 4:10)]\nOption: D\nReason: From 0:35 to 0:47, the camera shows a view of the city from above, and a billboard on the roof of a building across the street is visible. From 3:53 to 4:10, the camera is closer to the billboard. This aligns with the final instruction to \"stop near the billboard on the roof across the road and lower down a bit.\" Therefore, the agent is now stopping near the billboard and lowering itself a little further.",
