    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The side of the large rectangular gray building with multiple sections appears to have a designated area with marked spaces typical of a parking lot. There are no visible features such as water for a fountain, pool, or courtyard, nor greenery extensive enough to suggest a park. The layout and markings are consistent with vehicle parking spaces.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 18)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video frames from 0:13 to 0:18 provide a top-down view of the building complex. At the side of the large rectangular gray building (which is the central white building complex in these frames), there are clearly visible areas with white lines marked on a dark gray surface, indicating designated parking spaces. Several abstract vehicle shapes are also present in these spaces. This layout and these markings are characteristic of a parking lot. There are some green landscaped areas, but they are integrated with the road and parking infrastructure, not forming a large park. No fountains, large courtyards, or swimming pools are directly at the side of this specific building. The provided answer is correct and aligns with this observation.",
