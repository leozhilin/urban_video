  "question": "Question: At the initial position, you are asked to navigate forward towards an intersection, hovering when approaching the intersection, and then landing. What is your direction to the destination when you reach your current location?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am currently located above the intersection, preparing to hover and land.  \nB. I am currently far away from the intersection and need to fly forward for a longer distance.  \nC. I am currently on the right side of the intersection and need to fly forward and to the left.  \nD. I am currently on the left side of the intersection and need to fly forward and slightly to the right.  \nE. I am currently in front of the intersection and need to reverse.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The agent has reached a position directly above the intersection, as indicated by the clear view of the crossroads and the surrounding traffic. The agent is preparing to hover and land, which aligns with the goal of navigating forward towards and then hovering at the intersection.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 130)]\nOption: A\nReason: The video begins with an aerial view, showing the agent approaching a large intersection. As the video progresses, particularly from around 0:50 to 1:15, the camera descends and moves directly over the intersection, providing a clear overhead view of the crossroads and the surrounding traffic. This position aligns perfectly with the task description of \"hovering when approaching the intersection, and then landing.\" Therefore, the agent is currently located above the intersection, preparing for the next steps of hovering and landing. The provided answer correctly identifies this position and its alignment with the task.",
