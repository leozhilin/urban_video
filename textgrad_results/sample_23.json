    "evaluation": "Okay, I will analyze the video and the provided answer to give my evaluation in the requested format.\n\nLocation: [(128, 139), (320, 335), (410, 420)]\nOption: [E]\nReason: The navigation instructions lead the agent to fly over the pond and then navigate through the city streets to a blue building. The video shows the agent flying over the pond (1:28-1:39). Later, the agent navigates through city streets (5:20-5:30) and ends up near a blue building. The pond is visible in the distance (3:20-3:35, 4:10-4:20), indicating that the final location is far away from the pond. Therefore, the correct answer is that the agent is far away from the pond. The provided answer is correct.\n",
