The current perspective shows a straight path that does not lead directly to the cafe, while turning right aligns with the direction where the cafe's outdoor seating area is visible.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 4), (20, 51)]\nOption: E\nReason: At the initial position (00:00-00:04), the agent is facing forward on a wide street. To locate the \"ALL-STAR Cafe\" and its tables and chairs, which are shown to be on the right side of the street (visible from approximately 00:20 onwards, with the tables and chairs clearly seen from 00:47), the most logical next move from the initial forward-facing perspective is to turn right. This action would orient the agent towards the cafe's location. The provided answer correctly identifies \"I turn right\" as the next move and provides a valid reason that aligns with the visual evidence.",
