  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [taking off to the right and rotating by a pink building with stairs. flying through the buildings and passing by the red telephone cabin. rotating in between the buildings. zoom in to the instant coffee. flying to the top of the roof. rotating left going toward the buildings by the ocean. turning left and going toward the bridge.]. At the initial position, you are asked to navigate based on a series of movement instructions. What Landmark Position are you oriented to the ocean when you arrive at your current location?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am far away from the ocean.  \nB. I am at sea.  \nC. I am located above the ocean.  \nD. I am located on the left side of the ocean.  \nE. I am located on the right side of the ocean.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The sequence of images shows a progression from an initial position through various landmarks, ultimately arriving at a location where the ocean is visible to the right side of the perspective. This indicates that upon reaching the current location, the agent is oriented such that the ocean is on the right side.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 40)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instructions describe a series of movements, culminating in \"rotating left going toward the buildings by the ocean. turning left and going toward the bridge.\" From approximately 0:05 onwards, the video shows the agent's perspective. As the agent rotates and moves, the ocean consistently appears on the right side of the frame. In the final moments of the video (e.g., 0:30-0:40), the agent is positioned with the city buildings on the left and the vast expanse of the ocean on the right. This clearly indicates that at the current location (the end of the video sequence), the agent is oriented such that the ocean is on its right side. The provided answer correctly identifies this orientation.",
