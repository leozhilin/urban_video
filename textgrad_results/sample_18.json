    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The navigation instruction starts with \"turning left and going straight to the buildings,\" which suggests the initial action should be to turn left. Since the agent is at the initial position, turning left aligns with the first part of the given instructions. Descending might be necessary if the agent is at an elevated position, such as on a rooftop, to move towards the buildings at ground level. Therefore, option E, \"I turn left and descend,\" is the best next step.",
