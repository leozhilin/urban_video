At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best next step for you?\n\nchoose:  \nA. I go up and turn left.  \nB. I descend, turn right, and fly forward.  \nC. I fly forward and rotate the camera upward.  \nD. I turn right and go up.  \nE. I turn left and descend.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The navigation instruction starts with \"turning left and going straight to the buildings,\" which suggests the initial action should be to turn left. Since the agent is at the initial position, turning left aligns with the first part of the given instructions. Descending might also be necessary if the agent is at an elevated position, such as on a rooftop, to move towards the buildings at street level. Therefore, option E, \"I turn left and descend,\" is the best next step.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 5)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instruction explicitly states \"turning left and going straight to the buildings\". At the initial position (0:00), the agent is on a rooftop. To \"go straight to the buildings\" which are visible below and around, the agent must first descend from the current elevated position. Therefore, \"turning left and descending\" is the most appropriate first step to follow the instruction. The provided answer's reasoning aligns with this analysis, correctly identifying the need to turn left as per the instruction and inferring the necessity of descending due to the agent's elevated starting point.",
