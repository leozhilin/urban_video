    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The current location shows a large park with a fountain directly in front, surrounded by residential buildings. Behind the agent, there is a street visible, which matches the description in option D. The environment includes greenery and a designed water feature, typical of a park setting within a residential area.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 10), (30, 55), (11, 30)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video begins with a view looking into a residential complex. From 0:00 to 0:10, a large landscaped area with a fountain is clearly visible directly in front of the camera's perspective. This area is surrounded by numerous residential buildings. As the video pans from 0:11 to 0:30, a busy multi-lane street is revealed, which is located outside the entrance of this residential complex. Therefore, if the agent's \"current location\" is the vantage point from which the video starts, and the agent is initially looking into the complex, then the large park with a fountain is directly in front, surrounded by residential buildings, and the street is behind the agent. This perfectly matches the description in Option D. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with this visual evidence.",
