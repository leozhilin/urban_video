    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The video shows a bird's eye view of a road with a bus stop, pedestrians waiting at the bus stop, and a section of the road where vehicles are moving. This matches the description in option E.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:24, 2:40)]\nOption: E\nReason: From approximately 0:24, the camera begins to descend and provide a bird's eye view of the urban environment, with the road becoming a prominent feature. Throughout this descent and the subsequent overhead view, a section of the road with vehicles moving on it is clearly visible. As the video progresses and the camera gets a more direct overhead view, particularly from around 1:50 onwards, a bus stop on the side of the road comes into clear focus. Several pedestrians are observed waiting at or near this bus stop, especially from 2:14 to the end of the video. These observations directly and accurately match the description provided in option E.",
