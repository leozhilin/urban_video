    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The video shows a bird's eye view of a road where a bus stop, pedestrians, and a section of the road are clearly visible. This matches the description in option E.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:24, 2:40)]\nOption: E\nReason: As the drone descends over the road from approximately 0:24, a bird's eye view of the urban environment becomes clear. In this view, a multi-lane road with vehicles is consistently visible. As the descent continues and the camera gets closer and more directly overhead (especially from 2:00 onwards), a bus stop structure is clearly identifiable on the sidewalk next to the road, with people (pedestrians) waiting at it and walking on the adjacent pavement. The Chinese characters \"\u516c\u4ea4\" (g\u014dngji\u0101o, meaning public transport/bus) are also painted on the road surface near the bus stop. Therefore, \"a bus stop, pedestrians, and a section of road\" are all clearly observed objects during this descent. The provided answer correctly identifies these key elements.",
