  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [take off and turn right and cross the trees towards the pond. now turn right and move forward and go over the trees and get down towards the tree. now turn right and move forward and go over the buildings towards the white building. now turn right and move forward reach the top of the brown building and stay there.]. At the initial position, you are asked to navigate according to a series of movement instructions. When you reach the current location, what is your landmark position to the white building?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am to the left of the white building.  \nB. I am above the white building.  \nC. I am located underneath the white building.  \nD. I am located to the right of the white building.  \nE. I am located behind the white building.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The navigation instructions indicate that the agent has moved over buildings towards the white building and is currently at the top of a brown building. From this vantage point, the agent would be above the white building, making option B the correct choice.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 107)]\nOption: B\nReason: The question asks for the landmark position relative to the white building at the \"current location,\" which is understood to be the final destination described by the complete navigation instructions. The instructions state: \"...go over the buildings towards the white building. now turn right and move forward reach the top of the brown building and stay there.\" If the agent has gone \"over the buildings towards the white building\" and then reached \"the top of the brown building\" (which is presumably one of the buildings or in the vicinity of the buildings that were flown over), it logically follows that the agent is at a higher elevation than the white building. Therefore, the agent would be located above the white building. The video illustrates the journey but does not explicitly show the final position on top of the brown building or the white building itself, so the answer relies on interpreting the textual instructions for the final state. The provided answer's reasoning is correct and aligns with this interpretation.",
