You move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I go up and turn right.  \nB. I descend and fly forward.  \nC. I turn around and then rise.  \nD. I turn left and go up.  \nE. I rotate the camera downward.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The navigation instruction starts with \"take off and turn right move towards the base bridge.\" Given that the current view is from a high vantage point and the bridge is in sight, the next logical step is to execute the initial part of the instruction by going up (take off) and then turning right to align with the direction of the base bridge. This matches option A: \"I go up and turn right.\"",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:00, 0:25)]\nOption: A\nReason: The navigation instruction given at the initial position is \"[take off and turn right move towards the base bridge...]\".\n1.  **\"take off\"**: The video starts with the agent on a rooftop (0:00). \"Take off\" implies moving upwards from this initial position. This corresponds to \"I go up\".\n2.  **\"turn right move towards the base bridge\"**: After \"take off\", the instruction specifies \"turn right\". While the camera pans left (0:12-0:25) to reveal the base bridge, the instruction explicitly states to \"turn right\" to move towards it. This implies that from the agent's actual orientation, turning right is the correct action to align with the bridge.\nTherefore, the immediate next steps, directly following the initial instruction, are to \"go up\" (take off) and then \"turn right\". Option A, \"I go up and turn right,\" perfectly matches these two actions. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with this interpretation.",
