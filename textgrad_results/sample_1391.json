  "question": "Question: Why do you adjust your path, turning slightly to stay on course directly to the lake?  \nChoice: A. To avoid obstacles on the straight line.  \n           B. To get a better view of the city.  \n           C. To correct your trajectory toward the lake.  \n           D. To observe the treetops at close range.  \n           E. To speed up your descent.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The agent is adjusting its path to correct the trajectory toward the lake, as indicated by the gradual approach and alignment with the lake's position in the frames.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:14, 1:00)]\nOption: C\nReason: The question explicitly states that the agent is \"turning slightly to stay on course directly to the lake.\" This indicates that the agent's initial trajectory might not have been perfectly aligned with the lake, and a minor adjustment (a slight turn) was necessary to correct its path and ensure it remains on a direct course towards the intended destination, the lake. The video shows the agent moving from a high vantage point over the city, gradually approaching and aligning itself with the lake, which supports the idea of trajectory correction. The provided answer is consistent with this analysis.",
