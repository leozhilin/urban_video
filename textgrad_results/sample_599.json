    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The frames show the agent moving through an urban environment with clear views of building window facades, major intersections, and rooftops. There are no visible traffic circles, ponds, bridges, parked cars, street lights, fountains, or monuments in the provided images. The distant mountain is seen, but it is not a primary object observed while traversing the roads. Therefore, option E best matches the observed elements.",
