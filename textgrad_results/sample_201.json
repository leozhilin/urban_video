    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: Rising to the height of a higher floor after approaching a multi-story building using a triangular antenna allows for capturing a broader view or panorama of the surroundings, which is evident from the expansive view of the city and water body in the frames provided.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 25)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video shows the camera initially at street level, then rapidly ascending past the multi-story building with the triangular antenna. As the camera gains altitude (from approximately 0:10 to 0:25), the view expands significantly, revealing a vast panorama of the city and the expansive water body. This upward movement directly facilitates capturing a much broader and more comprehensive view of the surroundings, which is the definition of a panorama. Therefore, rising to a higher floor serves the purpose of capturing the panorama. The provided answer correctly identifies this.",
