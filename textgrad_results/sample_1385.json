    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The initial position shows a view between tall buildings with no visible balcony on the 29th floor. The perspective is too distant and obstructed to see such a specific detail as a balcony on a particular floor.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 3)]\nOption: D\nReason: At the initial position (00:00-00:03), the video displays a wide view of a city with several tall buildings. From this distant perspective, it is impossible to discern specific details such as individual balconies on a particular floor (e.g., the 29th floor) of any of the buildings. The buildings appear as generic structures, and no specific floor or balcony is visible or identifiable. Therefore, the destination is not within sight at the current location. The provided answer is correct.",
