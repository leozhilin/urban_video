Avoid obstacles on the street.  \n           C. Because the battery is dead.  \n           D. Maintain a consistent altitude throughout the flight.  \n           E.

From approximately 0:20 onwards, the drone begins to descend significantly while moving along the street. This descent brings the camera much closer to the ground level, allowing for a more detailed and clearer view of the parked cars along the roadside, the storefronts, and the pedestrians (e.g., 0:25-0:35, and especially 1:06-1:17 where it focuses on a red car). The purpose of this descent is clearly to gain a closer perspective of these specific elements, which supports the idea of getting a \"clearer view of the parked car and surrounding area.\" The provided answer is correct and well-reasoned.",
