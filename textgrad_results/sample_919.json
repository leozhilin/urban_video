    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The sequence of images shows the agent moving towards and then past the antenna tower. The final frames indicate that the agent has moved to a position where the antenna tower is on its right side, suggesting that the agent is now located to the right of the antenna tower.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 50), (50, 120), (120, 150)]\nOption: [E]\nReason: The agent starts on the ground, moves through the trees, flies over buildings, and then moves towards the antenna tower. The agent then turns right and moves forward, descending to a building near a bridge. The final frames show the agent on top of a building, with the antenna tower visible to the right. Therefore, the agent is located to the right of the antenna tower.",
