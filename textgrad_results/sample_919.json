  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [take off and move between to the two building and towards to the green tree and move into the tree. now turn right and fly over the buildings and get high and move forward near to the antenna tower. now turn right and move little forward and get down to the bridge and towards to the building and get down to the building and stay there.]. At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. What is your position relative to the antenna tower when you reach the current location?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am located to the left of the antenna tower.  \nB. I am far away from the antenna tower.  \nC. I am located below the antenna tower.  \nD. I am located above the antenna tower.  \nE. I am located to the right of the antenna tower.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The sequence of images shows the agent moving towards and then past the antenna tower. The final frames indicate that the agent has moved to a position where the antenna tower is on its right side, suggesting that the agent is now located to the right of the antenna tower.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(2:25, 2:33)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instructions guide the agent through several movements. The instruction \"move forward near to the antenna tower\" (visible from approximately 0:25 onwards, and prominently from 0:50 to 1:15) refers to an antenna tower located on a building to the agent's left during that phase of flight. After a subsequent turn to the right, a descent to the bridge level, and then moving towards and landing on a building, the agent reaches its final location. In the final frames of the video (from 2:25 to 2:33), the agent is stationary on a rooftop. From this vantage point, the antenna tower (the same one that was previously approached) is clearly visible on a building to the **left** of the agent's current perspective. If the antenna tower is to the left of the agent, then the agent is located to the right of the antenna tower.\n\nEvaluation of the provided answer:\nThe provided answer's chosen option E (\"I am located to the right of the antenna tower\") is correct based on the visual evidence and the navigation path. However, the reason provided contains a factual error in its description of the visual evidence. It states: \"The final frames indicate that the agent has moved to a position where the antenna tower is on its right side\". This is incorrect; in the final frames (e.g., 2:25-2:33), the antenna tower is on the **left** side of the agent's view. Despite this incorrect premise, the conclusion drawn from it (\"suggesting that the agent is now located to the right of the antenna tower\") is coincidentally correct, as an object being on the viewer's left means the viewer is to the object's right.",
