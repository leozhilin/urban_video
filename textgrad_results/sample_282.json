    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"take off, turn left, and fly towards the building present in the left.\" The first few frames show a transition from a ground-level view to an aerial perspective, indicating takeoff. The subsequent frames depict a movement towards a building on the left, aligning with the instruction to fly towards it after turning left. Therefore, the agent is currently executing the step of turning left and flying towards the building on the left.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 20)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instruction begins with \"take off turn left and fly towards the building present in the left\". The video frames from 0:00 to approximately 0:10 show the agent taking off, transitioning from a ground-level view to an aerial perspective. From around 0:10 onwards, the camera clearly turns left, and a large building becomes prominent on the left side of the screen. The agent then proceeds to fly towards this building (visible from 0:15 onwards). Therefore, the agent is currently executing the instruction to turn left and fly towards the building on the left. The provided answer is correct and aligns with the visual evidence.",
