    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The square opening in the roof or skylight is not within view. However, an intersection is visible in the lower part of the field of vision, making it the most relevant object in sight based on the provided options.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1)]\nOption: D\nReason: At the initial position (00:00), the video presents a high aerial view of a city block. From this perspective, specific \"square openings on the roof for ventilation or a skylight\" are not clearly visible or identifiable as a primary navigational target. However, a distinct intersection of roads is clearly visible in the lower part of the field of vision. This intersection serves as a prominent and relevant landmark for navigation. Therefore, option D accurately describes the most relevant object in sight given the initial view and the premise that the target openings are not clearly visible. The provided answer aligns with this analysis.",
