    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The sequence of images starts with a high aerial view over the city, then gradually descends towards a specific group of high-rise buildings. The perspective narrows down to focus on one particular building and its surroundings, which aligns with the description in option B. This trajectory is consistent with the visual progression from a broad cityscape to a detailed view of the street level near the \"Mr. Fan\" shop.",
