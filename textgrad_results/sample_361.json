    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The navigation instruction indicates that the agent should pass through several buildings, see a lake, and fly over the bridge in the middle of the lake. Given the current frames, the agent appears to be moving through a dense area of buildings. Since the lake is not visible in the current view and the agent has already passed through buildings, it suggests that the agent has moved beyond the lake. Therefore, the lake is behind the agent's current position.",
