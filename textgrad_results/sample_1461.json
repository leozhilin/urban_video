    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 20)]\nOption: A\nReason: The question asks for the direction to the balcony on the top floor of the building in front, where white clothes are hanging, from the current location. Observing the video from 0:00 to 0:20, the camera is positioned directly in front of a large residential building. Scanning the top floor of this building, specifically towards the right side, a balcony (or window acting as a balcony) can be identified with white clothes hanging out to dry. This specific balcony is located on the top-most floor, making it \"above\" the current viewpoint. Furthermore, it is positioned towards the right side of the building from the viewer's perspective, making it \"to my right\". Therefore, the target balcony is currently slightly above and to the right. The provided answer correctly identifies this direction.",
