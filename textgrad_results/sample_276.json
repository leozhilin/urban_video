  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [take off and turn right. fly down the street to to the yellow building, stopping over the building front of it. turn right, fly over the building in front of you and down to the one behind it. turn left, flying to the stairs at the columns building.]. At the initial position, you are asked to navigate according to a series of movement instructions. What are you doing now?  \nchoose:  \nA. I fly over buildings.  \nB. I fly in front of a building.  \nC. I fly across the water.  \nD. I turn back.  \nE. I turn right at the building.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"take off and turn right,\" which indicates the first action is a right turn. The subsequent frames show a progression of flying over buildings, aligning with the instructions to navigate through the urban environment by turning right and continuing over structures. Therefore, at the initial position, the action being performed is turning right at the building.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instruction explicitly states \"take off and turn right\" as the first actions. The video begins with the agent at a low altitude in front of a building. From approximately 0:00 to 0:10, the agent takes off, gaining altitude. Immediately after taking off, from around 0:10 to 0:15, the camera view clearly pans to the right, indicating a right turn is being executed. This turn is happening relative to the initial position and the building that was initially in front of the agent. Therefore, at the initial position, the agent is performing the action of turning right at the building. The provided answer correctly identifies this action based on the instructions and visual evidence.",
