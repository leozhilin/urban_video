  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [rise from the concrete and turn right. fly over the middle of the street until you reach the buildings on the left with the short concrete wall like structure around them. turn left right beside the buildings and fly along beside them. when you get to the middle darker brown building then angle straight up and fly toward the top of the building. before you get to the top turn right and begin to level off. fly toward the building with the half pipe or half circle design on the edge of the roof. when you get to the half circle then turn left and downward and fly toward the red roof of the smaller building beside the one you climbed. stop well before you get to the roof.]. At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I go up and turn right.  \nB. I descend and fly forward.  \nC. I fly forward while rising.  \nD. I turn left and descend.  \nE. I rotate the camera downward and fly forward.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The initial instruction states to \"rise from the concrete and turn right,\" which aligns with option A, indicating the need to ascend and make a right turn as the first action.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1)]\nOption: A\nReason: The navigation instruction explicitly states, \"rise from the concrete and turn right.\" Option A, \"I go up and turn right,\" directly corresponds to this initial command, indicating the immediate next steps the agent should take from the starting position. The video begins with the agent on the concrete, confirming the starting point for this instruction.",
