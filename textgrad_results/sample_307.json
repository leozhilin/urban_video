  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [take off and move between to the two building and towards to the green tree and move into the tree. now turn right and fly over the buildings and get high and move forward near to the antenna tower. now turn right and move little forward and get down to the bridge and towards to the building and get down to the building and stay there.]. At the initial position, you are asked to navigate based on a series of movement instructions. What is your position relative to the antenna tower when you reach your current location?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am located to the left of the antenna tower.  \nB. I am far away from the antenna tower.  \nC. I am located in front of the antenna tower.  \nD. I am located above the antenna tower.  \nE. I am located to the right of the antenna tower.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The sequence of images shows that the agent initially moves towards and then past the antenna tower. After turning right and moving forward, the agent's final position is to the right of the antenna tower, as indicated by the perspective in the later frames where the tower is visible to the left of the agent's view.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(00:29, 02:11)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instructions guide the agent through several movements. After the instruction \"fly over the buildings and get high and move forward near to the antenna tower,\" the antenna tower becomes visible on the left side of the screen (e.g., from 00:29 onwards). The agent then performs a second \"turn right\" (around 01:10) and continues to move forward and descend. Throughout this descent and at the final resting position on the building (from approximately 01:50 to 02:11), the antenna tower is consistently visible to the left of the agent's field of view. If the antenna tower is to the left of the agent's perspective, it means the agent's current location is to the right of the antenna tower. Therefore, the provided answer is correct.",
