    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The sequence of images shows the agent initially moving between buildings and towards a green tree, then turning right to fly over buildings and get high, moving forward near an antenna tower. After turning right again and moving forward, the agent gets down to a bridge and then to a building. In the final frames, the agent is positioned to the right of the antenna tower, as indicated by the perspective and the visible structure of the tower to the left in the field of view. Therefore, the correct position relative to the antenna tower is to the right.",
