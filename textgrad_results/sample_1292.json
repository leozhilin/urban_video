  "question": "Question: Starting from your starting position, you are required to navigate to the entrance of the community. There is a moon-shaped blue pool in front of you. What is the correct summary of your trajectory from the beginning to the current position?  \nChoice:  \nA. I start from above the park, move to the edge of the park, and then slowly rise to my current position.  \nB. I start from the street outside the community, move to the park, and then rise to the current height.  \nC. I start from the playground in the park, rise higher than the roof of the building, adjust my field of view upward, and then reach the current position.  \nD. I start from the scooter lane in the park, turn left to face the street outside the park, rise to the height of the high-rise building across the street, and then move to my current location.  \nE. I start from the community parking lot, move to the street, and then fly upward to my current location.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The trajectory starts from a playground within the park, rises higher than the roof of the building, and then adjusts the field of view upward to reach the current position. This matches the visual progression from ground level to an aerial view that encompasses the entire community area, including the playground, buildings, and surrounding roads.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 103)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video begins with an overhead view of a playground and a basketball court within a park, indicating the starting position is directly above or very close to the playground area (0:00-0:05). The camera then steadily rises, gaining significant altitude (0:05-0:58). As it ascends, it clearly goes higher than the roofs of the surrounding high-rise buildings, revealing more of the community and distant roads. Towards the end of the video (around 0:58-1:03), the camera slightly adjusts its field of view from a direct top-down perspective to a slightly more angled view, looking \"upward\" relative to the initial pure top-down, encompassing a wider horizon and reaching the final elevated position. This progression perfectly matches the description in Option C. The provided answer is consistent with the visual evidence.",
