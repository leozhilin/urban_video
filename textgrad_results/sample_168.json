    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The navigation instructions indicate that the agent is asked to fly over buildings and get down towards a brown building terrace. The current location, as seen from the frames, shows an elevated perspective above the buildings, suggesting that the agent is currently above the brown building. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(4:50, 5:14)]\nOption: B\nReason: The navigation instructions explicitly state \"now get up fly over the buildings and get down reach the brown terrace and stay there.\" The video frames from approximately 4:50 to 5:14 show the agent descending and then positioned on the roof (terrace) of a brown building. Being on the terrace of a building means the agent is located above the main structure of that building. Therefore, the agent is above the brown building. The provided answer correctly identifies the final position relative to the brown building based on the instructions and visual evidence.",
