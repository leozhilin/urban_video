  "question": "Question: How does the distance between you and the cylindrical building with blue windows change after you align with the row of floor numbers displayed on the building's facade?\n\nChoices:  \nA. The distance between me and the cylindrical building decreases.  \nB. The distance between me and the cylindrical building remains the same.  \nC. The distance between me and the cylindrical building increases.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: After aligning with the row of floor numbers displayed on the building's facade, the perspective shifts but does not indicate a change in the distance to the building. The view remains consistent with the building's details staying similarly sized and clear, suggesting the distance has not increased or decreased.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 5), (0, 115)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video shows a camera descending vertically along the side of the cylindrical building. From approximately 0:05 onwards, the camera is clearly aligned with the facade displaying floor numbers. Throughout this descent, the size of the windows and the floor numbers on the building's facade remain consistent, indicating that the horizontal distance between the camera (representing \"you\") and the building does not change. The movement is purely vertical, not horizontal. Therefore, the distance between the viewer and the cylindrical building remains the same. The provided answer correctly identifies this.",
