    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The trajectory starts from a high vantage point above the roof of the building, moves horizontally towards the front of the building, then descends to the playground area, and finally continues to the current position next to the playground. This matches the sequence of frames showing a descent from an aerial view to a closer view of the playground and surrounding buildings.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 10)]\nOption: [E]\nReason: The video starts with a view from above the roof of a building (0-2s), then moves horizontally towards the front of the building, showing the playground (2-6s), and finally descends to a position next to the playground (6-10s). This matches the description in option E.\n",
