  "question": "Question: What is the correct summary of your trajectory from the start to your current position?\nChoice:  \nA. I start above the basketball court, turn up and to the right, and then move forward to my current position above the runway.  \nB. I start from a high altitude above the teaching building, descend to the basketball court, and then move to my current position above the runway.  \nC. I start from above the trees near the basketball court, move upward to observe the entire sports field, and finally reach my current position above the runway.  \nD. I start above the basketball court, move upward and slightly to the right, and reach my current position above the runway.  \nE. I start from the ground near the teaching building, rise and fly toward the runway, and reach my current position above the runway.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The trajectory starts above the basketball court, then moves upward and slightly to the right, reaching the current position above the runway. This matches the visual progression from the initial frames over the basketball court to the final frames above the larger sports field, which includes a runway.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 51)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video begins with an aerial view directly above a basketball court (0:00-0:05). As the video progresses, the camera clearly moves upward, increasing its altitude, and simultaneously shifts slightly to the right, revealing a larger sports complex that includes a running track (often referred to as a runway in this context, especially for a drone's perspective) and a field (0:05-0:20). By the end of the video (0:20-0:51), the camera is positioned high above this running track/sports field, providing a wide overview. Therefore, the trajectory accurately described as starting above the basketball court, moving upward and slightly to the right, and ending above the runway. The provided answer is correct and aligns with the visual evidence.",
