    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The navigation instruction specifies to \"fly forward and turn left while descending\" towards the stairs at the columns building. The current view shows a clear path forward with a building that has columns visible ahead, indicating that the next step should involve moving forward and preparing to descend towards this target location.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15)]\nOption: E\nReason: From the current view (0-15s), the agent is positioned above a building. The instruction is to \"turn left, flying to the stairs at the columns building\". The video shows that the agent needs to fly forward and turn left to reach the building with columns and stairs. Also, the agent needs to descend to reach the stairs. Therefore, the best next step is to fly forward and turn left while descending.",
