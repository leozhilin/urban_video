  "question": "Question: Which takes longer for the you to descend toward the ocean or to approach the corner of the tallest building?\nChoice: A. Descend toward the ocean than it does to approach the corner of the tallest building.\n          B. Descent toward the ocean takes less time than it takes to approach the corner of the tallest building.\n          C. Descend toward the ocean at the same time as it approaches the corner of the tallest building.",

  "textgrad_result": {
    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The sequence of images shows that the agent approaches the corner of the tallest building relatively quickly, as the building's details become prominent in the later frames. In contrast, the descent toward the ocean is not depicted in these frames, suggesting it would take longer or occur after the current sequence, making the approach to the building faster.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 59)]\nOption: B\nReason: From the beginning of the video to 0:59, the agent is approaching the corner of the tallest building. The ocean is visible in the background, but there is no descent towards it. Therefore, approaching the corner of the tallest building takes less time than descending toward the ocean. The provided answer is correct.\n",
