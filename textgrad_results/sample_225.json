    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The balcony on the 12th floor is not within the field of view in the initial position. The view starts from a higher floor and moves downward, but at the beginning, only floors above the 12th are visible.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1)]\nOption: D\nReason: At the initial position (0:00), the camera is positioned high above the ground, looking upwards towards the sky and the very top sections of the buildings. No floor numbers are visible at this point, and the 12th floor is not within the field of view. The video then proceeds to pan downwards, revealing the lower floors of the building, with floor numbers becoming visible from the 31st floor downwards. The 12th floor only comes into sight much later in the video (around 0:48). Therefore, at the initial position, the balcony on the 12th floor is not within sight. The provided answer correctly identifies that the destination is not within the field of view at the initial position.",
