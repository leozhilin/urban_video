    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The agent is currently at a high vantage point overlooking the cityscape, and to navigate towards the blue roof of a nearby building, it needs to descend to reach the target location. Rising further (Option A) or hovering (Option G) would not bring the agent closer to the blue roof. Adjusting the field of view (Options C and F) or turning (Options D and E) would only change the perspective or direction but not the altitude, which is necessary to approach the building's roof. Therefore, descending (Option B) is the most appropriate next move.",
