    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current location, as depicted in the images, shows a view over a cityscape with no immediate sign of the optician's billboard. The agent appears to be at a significant distance from the initial reference point (the optician's billboard), indicating that it is far away from this landmark.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(00:50, 05:40)]\nOption: B\nReason: The navigation instructions state that the agent turns at the optician's billboard (around 00:50 in the video) and then proceeds to \"fly over 2 blocks of buildings then go lower to the ground... land on the far side of the sidewalk. turn to the left... fly forward. at the first intersection, stop... turn to the right... fly over the trees and decrease altitude until reaching the bridge.\" The video shows the agent executing a long sequence of movements, including flying over multiple city blocks, descending, landing, turning, and flying again for several minutes. By the end of the video (05:40), the agent is high above a different part of the city, looking down a long street towards the horizon. The original location of the optician's billboard is no longer visible and is clearly a significant distance away. Therefore, the agent is far away from the optician's billboard. The provided answer is correct.",
