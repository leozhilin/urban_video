    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The sequence of images shows a descent from an aerial view of a high-rise building to street level, followed by movement towards the main entrance. This matches the description in option D, which states \"I launch from the roof of the building, descend to street level, and approach the main entrance.\" The frames transition from a top-down view of buildings to a ground-level perspective near the entrance, confirming this trajectory.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 37)]\nOption: [D]\nReason: The video starts with a view from the roof of a high-rise building (0-5s). The camera then descends to street level (5-36s), and finally approaches the main entrance (36-37s). This trajectory matches option D: \"I launch from the roof of the building, descend to street level, and approach the main entrance.\" The provided answer is correct.\n",
