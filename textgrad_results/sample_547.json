  "question": "Question: You are navigating to the main entrance, what is the correct summary of your trajectory from the start to the current location?  \nChoice:  \nA. I start from the top of the high-rise building, descend to the ground, and move toward the main entrance.  \nB. I depart from the park, fly over the street, and land at the main entrance.  \nC. I start from the park, rise to the top of the high-rise building, descend to the ground, and then move toward the main entrance.  \nD. I launch from the roof of the building, descend to street level, and approach the main entrance.  \nE. I start from the roof, move to the street outside the park, descend to the ground, and move toward the main entrance.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The trajectory starts from an elevated position (the roof of a building), as seen in the initial frames with a high vantage point overlooking the city. The perspective then descends to street level, moving closer to the main entrance, which is evident from the final frames showing a detailed view of the entrance gate and surrounding area. This matches the description in option D.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 41)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video begins with an aerial view, showing a drone-like object on the roof of a building (00:00-00:01), which strongly suggests the starting point is the roof. The camera then continuously descends from this high vantage point (00:01-00:36) until it reaches street level, as evidenced by the close-up view of the pavement and the shift to a ground-level perspective. Finally, the agent approaches and is positioned directly in front of the main entrance (00:37-00:41). This trajectory perfectly matches the description in option D: \"I launch from the roof of the building, descend to street level, and approach the main entrance.\" The provided answer's reasoning is correct and aligns with the visual evidence.",
