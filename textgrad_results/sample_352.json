    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 21)]\nOption: A\nReason: The video consistently shows a small drone-like icon, representing the agent, hovering directly above the flat roof of a large building. The perspective is primarily top-down, clearly illustrating that the agent is positioned directly over the building's rooftop. The question states that the agent was asked to navigate to the roof of the building directly below its starting position. The video then shows the agent's \"current location,\" which is precisely that destination. Therefore, the agent is currently located directly above the roof of the target building. The provided answer correctly identifies this.",
