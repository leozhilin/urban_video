  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [fly to the left side of the bridge. go forward to the end of the bridge. pass one road and take a right. fly over the short building near the park with the billboard on top. fly to the left down the road. fly down after you pass one road. go to the yellow billboard on the left over the building. go straight to the end of the park. go to the next road and fly over the buildings on the right. fly back to the left to the road and look at the billboard on the right. fly over the billboard and go straight. go around the right side of the building behind the yellow billboard. go to the road behind the sky scraper. turn left and look down the road. the red phone booths will be on your right. fly up and look left at the sky scraper. fly to the top and stop.]. At the initial position, you are asked to follow a series of movement instructions. What is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I fly forward and then rise.  \nB. I descend and turn right.  \nC. I fly forward while rising.  \nD. I turn left and descend.  \nE. I rotate the camera downward.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"fly to the left side of the bridge,\" which implies that the agent should start by moving forward and rising to navigate around the bridge structure effectively. This aligns with option A, which suggests flying forward and then rising, setting the correct trajectory for the subsequent steps in the navigation instructions.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 10)]\nOption: A\nReason: From the video, the agent is on the bridge. The instruction is to \"fly to the left side of the bridge\". So the agent should fly forward and then rise to the left side of the bridge. So option A is the best next step. The provided answer is correct.\n\nLocation: [(0, 10)]\nOption: A\nReason: The initial view shows the agent on a bridge. The instruction is to \"fly to the left side of the bridge.\" This implies moving forward and upward to clear the bridge structure and position the agent on its left side. Therefore, option A, \"I fly forward and then rise,\" is the most appropriate initial action.\n\n",
