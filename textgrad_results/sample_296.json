Therefore, the entire video is relevant to answering the question.\n*   **Analyze video segments:**\n    *   (0:00-0:15): The video starts with a view from a bridge, looking towards two prominent towers and the city skyline. The agent is at ground level. The instruction is to zoom in on the left tower.\n    *   (0:15-0:30): The view changes, showing the city from a higher vantage point. This suggests the agent has taken off. The instruction is to resume flying over green bush.\n    *   (0:30-0:45): The view continues to show the city from an elevated position, confirming the agent is flying.\n    *   (0:45-01:23): The view continues to show the city from an elevated position, confirming the agent is flying.\n\nBased on the video, the agent is currently flying over the city buildings.\n\n**2.
