    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The sequence of images shows the agent moving forward and then approaching a statue, which aligns with the instruction to \"get down at above statue.\" Following this, the agent turns left and moves forward, which is consistent with the next part of the instruction. The current view in the images indicates that the agent is now over the trees, as described in the navigation instruction. Therefore, option A is the correct choice based on the current position relative to the given instructions.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 36), (36, 48), (48, 60)]\nOption: A\nReason: The instruction is to \"take off and move forward and get down at above statue and turn left and move forward and go over the trees and beside pond\". From 0 to 36, the agent takes off and moves forward and gets down at above statue. From 36 to 48, the agent turns left and moves forward. From 48 to 60, the agent goes over the trees and beside pond. So the answer is A. I am over the trees.\n\n",
