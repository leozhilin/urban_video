    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"zoom in on the left tower,\" and the sequence of images shows a gradual zoom towards one of the towers, indicating that this action is currently being performed.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 41)]\nOption: D\nReason: The navigation instruction given at the initial position starts with \"[zoom in on the left tower.]\". Observing the video frames from 00:00 to 00:41, the camera initially shows two towers in the distance. As the video progresses, particularly from around 00:14 onwards, the camera clearly begins to zoom in on the left tower, making it larger and more prominent in the frame, while the right tower moves out of view. This visual evidence directly corresponds to the first instruction, indicating that the action of zooming in on the left tower is currently being performed. The provided answer correctly identifies this action.",
