    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The surrounding environment includes a school playground with a runway, which is visible in the frames. Additionally, there are multiple buildings around, including a multi-story apartment building and a red brick school building, which matches the description in option C. The presence of a road below also aligns with the observed scene.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:36, 1:11)]\nOption: C\nReason: As the drone ascends and pans, starting from approximately 0:36, a school playground with a running track (runway) becomes clearly visible to the left and then behind the red classroom building as the drone approaches it. The video shows multiple buildings in the surrounding area, including the multi-story apartment building (the one with many air conditioners) that the drone initially ascended past, and the target red brick school building. A road is also visible below the drone's flight path, particularly from 0:40 onwards. Therefore, option C accurately describes the surrounding environment at the current location when navigating to the roof of the red classroom building. The provided answer is correct and its reasoning is sound.",
