  "question": "Question: At the initial position, you are asked to navigate to the roof of a building three floors ahead. Thinking back on past actions and objects you saw, what should you approach next in order to get from your current location to the destination?  \nchoose:  \nA. I approach the top of the tallest building in front.  \nB. I approach the lamppost on the street corner.  \nC. I approach the edge of the parking lot next to the building.  \nD. I approach the roof of the second floor behind me.  \nE. I approach the open space on the roof of the three-story building.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The goal is to navigate to the roof of a building three floors ahead. From the current perspective, the open space on the roof of the three-story building is visible and accessible, making it the logical next step towards reaching the destination.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 55)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video starts with an aerial view, showing a central, lower-rise building surrounded by taller residential towers. The question asks to navigate to \"the roof of a building three floors ahead.\" As the video progresses, the camera descends and moves directly towards this central building, providing a clear view of its roof. This building appears to be approximately three stories high. The roof of this building is a large, flat, open space, making \"the open space on the roof of the three-story building\" the direct and logical next approach to reach the specified destination. Options A, B, C, and D describe locations that are either incorrect in terms of the target building (tallest building, behind me) or are at ground level (lamppost, parking lot edge), which would not lead to the roof. The provided answer aligns with this analysis.",
