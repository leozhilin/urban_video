Specifically, Frame 1 shows the agent at ground level, while Frame 3 clearly depicts an aerial view, confirming the ascent. After rising, the agent moves forward, as seen in Frames 4-6 where the cityscape becomes more prominent. The ""turn back"" instruction is addressed subsequently, as the agent changes direction, evident in Frames 7-9 where the perspective shifts. Therefore, ""I fly forward when rising"" (Option C) aligns best with the initial step of taking off and moving forward as instructed.",C,False

Choices:  
A. To adjust your path away from the road.  
B. To avoid air traffic above the intersection.  
C. Due to wind interference.  
D. To focus on your destination.  
E. To maintain altitude stability.  ",Causal,D,"Option: A; Reason: The video shows a continuous movement along the street, and as the agent approaches the intersection, there is a noticeable veer to the left. This adjustment in path aligns with the row of buildings on the left side, suggesting an intention to move away from the open road and closer to the building structures. Specifically, the agent's path becomes parallel to the left-side buildings, indicating a deliberate maneuver to navigate alongside them. There is no indication of air traffic, as the sky is clear and no aircraft are visible, ruling out any influence from air traffic. Additionally, the agent's steady path and the stable appearance of the buildings indicate no significant wind interference. Although focusing on a destination is plausible, the immediate action of veering left is more directly related to adjusting the path rather than a distant goal. Furthermore, the agent maintains a consistent altitude throughout, indicating no need for adjustments related to stability. Therefore, the most plausible reason is to adjust the path away from the road, making option A the correct choice.",A,False

Choices:  
A. To ascend to a higher altitude.  
B. To avoid an obstacle on the road.  
C. To capture a better view of the lake.  
D. Because my destination is more likely to exist on the left side of the road by the lake.  
E. To descend towards the ground.  ",Causal,D,"Option: D; Reason: The video shows a continuous movement along a road that curves to the left, leading closer to a lake visible on the left side. As the agent follows the road's curve, the view of the lake becomes more prominent, with the lake occupying a significant portion of the left visual field by the end of the sequence. There are no visible obstacles (ruling out option B), and the path does not indicate an intention to ascend or descend significantly (ruling out options A and E). Additionally, the primary focus seems to be on reaching a location near the lake rather than merely capturing a view (ruling out option C). Specifically, the road's alignment and the increasing visibility of the lake suggest that the destination is likely situated by the lake on the left side of the road. Therefore, the most logical reason for adjusting the path to align with the road's curve towards the left is because the destination is more likely to exist on the left side of the road by the lake.",D,True

E. There are several small houses surrounding me. In front is an open space covered with some small shrubs. There aren't any high-rise buildings in sight.  ",Cognitive Map,A,"Option: A; Reason: The video shows a large construction site with a prominent tower crane to the right, which aligns with option A. Additionally, there are many high-rise residential buildings visible in the background. The area behind the current position appears to be a street with some vehicles, further supporting the description in option A. The other options do not match the visual evidence from the video as accurately.",A,True
AerialVLN_42_30OG32W0S39MANQLMPLARTM4IDDNE3_0.mp4,"Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [take off and turn right move forward and fly towards the top of brown tower. now turn right move little forward near by pond slow down to the floor. now turn left move towards the mid centre of pond behind the tree slow down and stay there.]. At the initial position, you are asked to follow a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is your best next step?  
choose:  
A. I go up and turn right.  
B. I descend and then fly forward.  
C. I fly forward while descending.  
D. I turn left and descend.  
E. I rotate the camera up, then down.  ",Action Generation,B,"Option: A; Reason: The navigation instruction explicitly states to ""take off and turn right, move forward and fly towards the top of the brown tower."" From the initial position shown in Frame 1, which depicts a ground-level view between buildings, the best next step is to take off (go up) and then turn right. This aligns with the first part of the given instructions and prepares for moving forward toward the specified brown tower. Frames 6-10 show the beginning of the ascent, confirming that taking off is the correct initial action. Frames 16-24 depict an aerial view, further validating the ascent and the subsequent turn right. Therefore, option A, ""I go up and turn right,"" is the most appropriate choice based on the provided instructions and visual evidence from the video.",A,False
