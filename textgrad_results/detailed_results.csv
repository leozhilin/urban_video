C.	I am located to the left of the intersection beside the tall building.
D.	I am located behind the intersection beside the tall building.
E.	I am located in front of the intersection beside the tall building.

”””
```
",B,"Option: E; Reason: In frames 11-30, the agent is clearly in front of the intersection beside the tall building as it flies along the road at a higher altitude.

D. I am currently located in the air outside the building's exterior wall, over the sidewalk, and my relative position to the store is unknown.  
E. I am currently located in front and right of the destination, flying at high altitude.  ",D,"Option: E; Reason: The video frames consistently show a bird's eye view of the cityscape, indicating that the agent is flying at a high altitude. There is no indication of being at street level or directly above a specific building, which rules out options A, B, C, and D. The persistent aerial perspective throughout the frames supports the choice of option E, depicting a high-altitude location in front and to the right of the destination.",E,False

C. I turn back.  
D. I turn right at the building.  
E. I move slightly to the right so that I can navigate between buildings.

RealWorld_16.mp4,"Question: If you do not fly directly to the building with the green mesh balcony, but choose to fly over the intersection first, can you still reach your destination, and how does the route compare?

Choice: A. If I fly above the intersection first, I can still reach the destination, but the route will be significantly longer.  
           B. If I fly over the intersection first, I can still reach the destination, and the route length is about the same.  
           C. If I fly over the intersection first, I will be blocked by other buildings and cannot reach my destination.  ",C,"Option: B; Reason: The video frames show the agent successfully reaching the destination by flying over the intersection, indicating that this route is feasible. The route appears to be slightly longer than a direct route but provides a clear path without significant obstacles. Specific visual evidence from frames 1-10, 11-30, 31-50, and 51-60 supports this conclusion.",B,False

B. Due to unexpected weather conditions.  
C. To capture a wider area of ​​your surroundings.  
D. Due to malfunction.  
E. To reach the terrace more directly.  ",E,"Option: C; Reason: The height increase, as observed in frames 13-22, allows the agent to capture a wider area of the surroundings. Initially, in frames 9-12, the agent's view is limited to the street level and nearby buildings.

It progresses steadily along a trajectory that remains parallel to the adjacent skyscrapers, evidencing a consistent altitude without noticeable ascent or descent. While the agent descends slightly to approach street-level features such as trees and crosswalks, there is no explicit evidence of landing on or targeting the roof of a lower building. This observation slightly deviates from Option E's specific mention of 'the roof of a lower building.'

C. I fly forward while descending.  
D. I turn left and go up.  
E. I rotate my camera upward and fly forward.",B,"Option: B; Reason: The agent is at a low altitude near buildings, indicating the need to ascend (""take off"").

B. I am currently locating directly above the target building, much higher than the 19th floor.  
C. I am currently locating on the left side of the target building, close to the 19th floor.  
D. I am currently locating on the ground to the right of the target building.  
E. I am currently locating on the right side of the target building, much higher than the 19th floor.  ",E,"Option: A; Reason: Analyzing frames 1-5 reveals the agent's initial position relative to the target building. These frames depict a high vantage point between two tall buildings, showing the agent at an elevated position above the cityscape but below the 19th floor. The target building is visible, with the agent approaching from the left side at a lower elevation. This rules out options B (not directly above), C (not close to the 19th floor), and D (not on the ground). Therefore, option A is most plausible: the agent is on the left side of the target building and far below the 19th floor. This is supported by the wide-angle view and the agent's lower elevation relative to the target floor.",A,False
