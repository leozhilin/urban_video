    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The goal is to navigate to the underground garage near the residential area. Given the current view, the next logical step is to decline (move downward) to enter the underground garage, which is typically accessed by going down a ramp or entrance.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:00, 1:19)]\nOption: B\nReason: From the initial position at 0:00, the agent (drone) is at a high aerial vantage point. The question asks to navigate to an underground garage. To access an underground garage from a high altitude, the most fundamental and necessary \"next step\" is to decline, or move downward. The video clearly demonstrates this by showing the drone descending from its high initial position (0:00) towards the residential buildings, eventually revealing the ground-level entrance to the underground garage around the 1:06 mark. This downward movement is crucial for reaching and accessing an underground facility. The provided answer correctly identifies \"decline\" as the logical next step.",
