At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. When you reach the current location, what is your landmark position relative to the trees?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am to the left of the trees.  \nB. I am on the right side of the trees.  \nC. I am positioned above the trees at a horizontal distance.  \nD. I am located beneath the trees.  \nE. I am located in the middle of the trees.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current view shows that the agent is on the right side of the trees, as the trees are aligned to the left of the perspective in the final frames.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(2:40, 2:41)]\nOption: B\nReason: The navigation instructions are \"go to sun. go to brown building. go towards trees.\". The video shows the agent following the first two instructions. At the final position (2:40-2:41), the agent has reached the vicinity of the brown building. From this vantage point, looking at the brown building, the trees (palm trees lining a distant road/highway) are visible far in the distance, to the left of the agent's current perspective. If the trees are to the left of the agent's view, it means the agent is positioned on the right side of the trees. The provided answer's reason aligns with this observation.",
