    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current location, as depicted in the images, shows a view of the cityscape with multiple buildings but does not indicate proximity to a specific \"brown glass-roofed building.\" The agent appears to be at a distance from any particular building with such a description, suggesting that it is far away from the brown building with a glass roof.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 45)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video shows the agent moving through the environment. Based on the navigation instructions, the agent was asked to move towards the brown building with a glass top, then turn back and get closer to the blue building, and then get high. The video shows the agent is currently near the blue building and is at a high altitude. Therefore, the agent is far away from the brown building with a glass roof.",
