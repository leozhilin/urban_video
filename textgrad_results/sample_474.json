    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The navigation instructions indicate moving above the pool to reach the street, suggesting that the final orientation relative to the pool is from an elevated position. Therefore, the correct answer is that you are located above the pool.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:00, 2:20), (3:00, 4:12)]\nOption: D\nReason: The navigation instructions state, \"move forward to see the pool shines by sunlight and cross the pool to reach the street.\" This movement is visible from approximately 1:00 to 2:20, where the camera flies over the pool. Subsequently, the instructions direct the agent to \"move towards to the top of the building\" (2:20-2:40), further increasing elevation. Finally, the agent is instructed to \"turn left side and move towards the pool\" (3:00-3:10) and then \"move towards to the street\" (3:10-3:30), and then along the street (3:30-end). Throughout these latter stages, particularly from 3:00 onwards to the end of the video, the camera maintains a high vantage point, consistently showing the pool far below. Therefore, at the final position, the agent is located above the pool. The provided answer correctly identifies this orientation.",
