    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The bus stop is typically marked by a light pole or similar structure near the road, and approaching this would guide you to the correct location.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 4)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video frame (0:00-0:04) shows an aerial view of the initial position. The question asks to navigate to the bus stop in front of the building. Observing the image, a bus stop bench is clearly visible on the sidewalk directly in front of the pink building. Immediately next to this bus stop bench, there is a light pole. Therefore, approaching this light pole is a direct and accurate way to reach the bus stop. The provided answer correctly identifies the light pole as a key landmark for the bus stop, and its reasoning is consistent with the visual evidence.",
