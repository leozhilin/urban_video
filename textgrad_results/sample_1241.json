  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [take off turn left and fly towards the building present in the left and fly upwards from the building and turn left and fly straight and cross the first two buildings and fly downwards to the small building and fly upwards. cross the building and fly straight to the advertisement banner and turn left and turn right after crossing the first right and cross the eds butcher shop banner fly downwards in front of the juniors restaurant and bar. turn around the area on right left and turn turn at the opposite of the juniors restaurant.]. At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I go up and turn right.  \nB. I descend and then fly forward.  \nC. I rotate the camera downward, then fly forward.  \nD. I turn left and descend.  \nE. I rise and then fly forward.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"take off turn left and fly towards the building present in the left.\" Since the agent is at the initial position on the ground, the best next step is to rise and then fly forward to align with the path that allows turning left towards the building. This matches option E, which involves rising and then flying forward, setting up the correct trajectory for the subsequent left turn.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15)]\nOption: E\nReason: The initial instruction given is \"take off turn left and fly towards the building present in the left\". At the beginning of the video (0:00-0:01), the agent is at ground level. The command \"take off\" explicitly means to gain altitude or rise. Following this, to \"fly towards the building present in the left,\" the agent would need to move forward in that general direction. The video shows the agent rising from approximately 0:01 to 0:10, and then the view starts to pan left and move forward, revealing buildings on the left side of the screen by 0:14-0:15. Therefore, the most appropriate immediate next step to begin executing the instruction is to \"rise and then fly forward\" (Option E), which allows the agent to take off and then position itself to turn left towards the building. The provided answer's reasoning is correct and aligns with this analysis.",
