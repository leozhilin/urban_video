    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The sequence of images shows the agent flying over buildings, which aligns with the navigation instruction to \"go over the buildings.\" The perspective is consistently from an elevated position, indicating flight or movement above the structures.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(04:20, 05:15)]\nOption: D\nReason: The navigation instruction states, \"now turn right and go over the buildings towards the brown building.\" From approximately 04:20 onwards, after completing a right turn, the agent's perspective is consistently from an elevated position, showing it moving above the rooftops of various buildings. This directly corresponds to the instruction \"go over the buildings.\" Therefore, the agent is currently flying over buildings.",
