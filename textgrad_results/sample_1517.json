From this point until the end of the video at 1:58, the camera descends and moves significantly closer to the store. This is evident as the store occupies a progressively larger portion of the screen, and its details become much clearer. Therefore, the distance between the camera (representing \"you\") and the store decreases. The provided answer is correct.",
