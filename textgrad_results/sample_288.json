    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The trajectory starts from a lower altitude near the park, moves forward towards the street, rises to the height of the high-rise building across the street, and then proceeds to the current position in front of the red billboard building. This matches the sequence of images showing a progression from ground level near greenery, rising above street level with visible traffic, and finally focusing on the building with the red billboard.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 57)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video starts with a view of greenery and buildings, then rises to show the street and traffic, and finally focuses on the building with the red billboard.
