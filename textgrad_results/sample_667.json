  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [rise from the concrete and turn right. fly over the middle of the street until you reach the buildings on the left with the short concrete wall like structure around them. turn left right beside the buildings and fly along beside them. when you get to the middle darker brown building then angle straight up and fly toward the top of the building. before you get to the top turn right and begin to level off. fly toward the building with the half pipe or half circle design on the edge of the roof. when you get to the half circle then turn left and downward and fly toward the red roof of the smaller building beside the one you climbed. stop well before you get to the roof.]. At the initial position, you are asked to navigate according to a series of movement instructions. What is the Landmark Position of the intersection with the high-rise building when you reach the current location?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am located above the high-rise building bypass intersection.  \nB. I am far away from the high-rise building bypass intersection.  \nC. I am on the ground near the intersection of high-rise buildings.  \nD. I am located on the left side of the high-rise building bypass intersection.  \nE. I am under the intersection next to the high-rise building.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The agent has navigated to a position above the high-rise building bypass intersection, as indicated by the elevated perspective and the visible tops of surrounding buildings. This aligns with the instruction to \"angle straight up and fly toward the top of the building,\" suggesting the agent is now above the intersection area.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 30), (30, 60), (110, 130), (230, 260), (260, 300)]\nOption: [A]\nReason: From the beginning of the video to 30 seconds, the agent is on the ground. From 30 seconds to 60 seconds, the agent is flying up. From 1 minute 10 seconds to 1 minute 30 seconds, the agent is flying up. From 2 minutes 30 seconds to 3 minutes, the agent is flying up. From 2 minutes 30 seconds to 3 minutes, the agent is flying up. Therefore, the agent is located above the high-rise building bypass intersection.",
