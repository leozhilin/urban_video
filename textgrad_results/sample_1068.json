  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [Raise the altitude, fly over the opposite road, and fly in the direction of the mountains]. You move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is your best next step?  \nchoose:  \nA. I rise and then fly forward.  \nB. I descend and turn left.  \nC. I turn left and fly forward.  \nD. I turn right and descend.  \nE. I rotate the camera downward and fly forward.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The initial navigation instruction is to \"Raise the altitude, fly over the opposite road, and fly in the direction of the mountains.\" Given the current position above a parking lot, the best next step is to rise and then fly forward to gain the necessary altitude and clear any immediate obstacles, aligning with the first part of the instruction to raise the altitude. This sets up the agent to safely navigate over the opposite road and towards the mountains.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 14)]\nOption: A\nReason: The initial navigation instruction explicitly states \"Raise the altitude, fly over the opposite road, and fly in the direction of the mountains.\" The agent's current position is above a parking lot, surrounded by buildings, indicating a relatively low altitude. To successfully execute the subsequent parts of the instruction (\"fly over the opposite road\" and \"fly in the direction of the mountains\"), the agent must first gain sufficient altitude to clear any immediate obstacles (like the surrounding buildings) and obtain a clear line of sight towards the \"opposite road\" and \"mountains,\" which are not clearly visible from the current low perspective. Therefore, \"I rise\" is the most immediate and necessary first action. Following this, \"and then fly forward\" is the logical next step to proceed towards the specified destination. The provided answer correctly identifies these points and aligns with the given instruction and visual context.",
