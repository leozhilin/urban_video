  "question": "Question: Combined with the specific objects along your way, summarize your movement route.\n\nChoice:  \nA. I take a bird's-eye view of a section of road with bus stops and pedestrians from a high-rise residential area. I first move backward and upward, then tilt downward, move forward and downward, descend above a road, and move slightly forward and downward, finally descending to a bird's-eye view.  \nB. I fly directly over the open space below from the hazy urban landscape in the distance, towards the high-rise residential complex.  \nC. I go from a bird's-eye view of cars and shops parked on either side of the road to seeing roads, shops, and parking lots at street level by rising to a higher altitude.  \nD. I turn from the outside of the balcony of a high-rise residential building to the road on the ground, advance to the sky above the road, descend, and turn to the bus stop directly opposite the roadside.  \nE. I take a bird's-eye view of a section of road with bus stops and pedestrians and reach a section of high-rise residential buildings by moving upward and forward.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The video starts with a view of high-rise residential buildings and gradually moves to a bird's-eye view of the road below, capturing bus stops and pedestrians. The movement is consistent with first moving backward and upward, then tilting downward to focus on the road, and finally descending to a bird's-eye view of the street scene.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 30), (30, 45), (45, 1:00), (1:00, 1:30), (1:30, 2:00), (2:00, 2:35)]\nOption: A\nReason: The video begins with a close-up view of high-rise residential buildings (0-7s). It then gradually moves backward and upward to provide a bird's-eye view of the surrounding area (7-15s). The camera then tilts downward, focusing on the road below, capturing bus stops and pedestrians (15-30s). Finally, the camera descends to a bird's-eye view of the street scene (30-45s), showing the road, shops, and parking lots. The movement is consistent with first moving backward and upward, then tilting downward to focus on the road, and finally descending to a bird's-eye view of the street scene.",
