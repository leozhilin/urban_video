    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: Based on the navigation instruction, the next step involves turning right and going forward towards the sports area. The current view shows a clear path ahead with trees and open space, indicating that turning right and descending would align with moving towards the specified destination.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(2:00, 2:17)]\nOption: D\nReason: The navigation instruction states: \"...towards arrives the sports area till turn right.\" The video shows the agent arriving at and hovering over the sports area from approximately 2:00 to 2:17. Therefore, according to the instruction, the immediate next step is to \"turn right\". The agent has been flying at a relatively high altitude throughout the video. Given that subsequent instructions involve crossing a road and a swimming pool, it is logical for the agent to descend to a lower altitude to facilitate these movements. Thus, \"turn right and descend\" is the most appropriate next step.\n\nThe provided answer correctly identifies Option D. However, its reason states \"the next step involves turning right and going forward towards the sports area.\" This is inaccurate. The instruction says the agent \"arrives the sports area till turn right,\" implying the agent has *already arrived* at the sports area, and the turn right is the action *upon arrival*, not a movement *towards* it. Despite this minor inaccuracy in the reasoning's description of the current state, the chosen action (turning right and descending) aligns with the instruction and logical drone navigation.",
