    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The next step in the navigation instruction is to \"fly high on the brick building and show the fire exits,\" which requires ascending. Therefore, flying upward (Option E) aligns with this requirement.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 8)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instruction given at the initial position clearly states \"fly high on the brick building and show the fire exits.\" To \"fly high,\" the agent must move upward. The video immediately shows the agent ascending from the initial ground-level view (0:00-0:08), which directly corresponds to the instruction to \"fly high.\" Therefore, \"I fly upward\" is the best next step. The provided answer is correct.",
