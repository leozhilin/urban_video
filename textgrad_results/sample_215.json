    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 4)]\nOption: C\nReason: At the initial position (0:00-0:04), the camera shows a wide view of a city street with buildings and trees. The \"ALL-STAR Cafe\" and its stairs are not visible in this initial field of view. The camera later pans and zooms to reveal the \"CENTRAL ALL-STAR\" building and its stairs (around 0:43-0:53), but this is not the initial view. Therefore, the destination is not within sight at the current (initial) location. The provided answer is correct.",
