  "textgrad_result": {
    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The descent beside the building involves a significant vertical drop, which typically takes more time due to the need to control the speed of descent. In contrast, the passage over trees and streetlights is primarily horizontal, which can be traversed more quickly given the lack of vertical movement challenges.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 5), (53, 57), (59, 106)]\nOption: C\nReason: The descent beside the building, as seen from 0 to 5 seconds, involves a significant vertical drop.
