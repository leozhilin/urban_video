    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The center of the square features a white cuboid stele, which is clearly visible as the agent approaches the stone statues in front of the gate. The other options do not match the observed structure in the images provided.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:39, 0:52)]\nOption: D\nReason: As the video progresses and the camera provides an overhead view of the square, particularly from 0:39 onwards, a long, white, rectangular object is clearly visible in the center of the paved area, positioned between the viewer and the stone statues in front of the gate. This object perfectly matches the description of a \"white cuboid stele.\" The other options (water fountain, flagpole, tall streetlamp, artistic sculpture) are not present or do not accurately describe the object at that central location. The provided answer is correct.",
