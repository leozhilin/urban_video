  "question": "Question: Where are the starting and ending points of your journey?  \nChoice:  \nA. Start from the tree-lined paths on both sides and end around the circular open space of the children's playground in the park.  \nB. Start from a position overlooking the park and end in a circular open space in the children's playground.  \nC. Begin descent over a green area and end on a path that curves to the right next to a rocky area.  \nD. Begin on a path that curves to the right next to a rocky area and end overlooking the park.  \nE. Start from a turn centered on the playground and end as you descend over the green space.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The journey starts with a view that overlooks the park, as seen in the initial frames where the perspective is high and broad, capturing a wide area of the park. As the sequence progresses, the agent moves towards and ends up in a circular open space that is characteristic of a children's playground, which is evident from the playground equipment and the defined circular area in the later frames.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 5), (25, 37)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video begins with a high, wide shot (0:00-0:05) that clearly shows an expansive park area from an elevated perspective, indicating a starting position \"overlooking the park.\" As the video progresses, the camera descends and moves towards a specific area. The journey concludes with the camera positioned directly above a distinct circular area filled with various structures identifiable as playground equipment (0:25-0:37), confirming the ending point as a \"circular open space in the children's playground.\" The provided answer correctly identifies both the starting and ending points based on these visual cues.",
