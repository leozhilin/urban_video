At the initial position, you are asked to follow a series of movement instructions to navigate. When you reach the current location, what is your landmark position relative to the bridge?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am on the left side of the bridge.  \nB. I am on the right side of the bridge.  \nC. I am in front of the bridge.  \nD. I am under the bridge.  \nE. I am behind the bridge.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The navigation instructions indicate moving past the bridge and continuing further into the environment, which suggests that the current position is behind the bridge relative to the initial direction of approach.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:15, 3:19)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instructions guide the agent from an initial position in a park towards a city. The instruction \"go straight and move to the bridge and turn right into the building. ... go straight and move to cross the lake and nearby the building blocks\" indicates that the agent approaches the bridge, then crosses the lake, and ends up among the city buildings.\n\nVisually, the bridge first becomes clearly visible around 1:15 on the left side of the view as the agent moves towards the city. From approximately 1:30 to 1:50, the agent is shown crossing the lake, with the bridge still visible to the left, spanning the same body of water. The agent then enters a building on the city side (around 2:10) and eventually moves to a rooftop (from 2:50 onwards), which is the current location at the end of the video (3:05-3:19).\n\nSince the agent started on the park side of the lake and has now crossed the lake to the city side, the bridge (which connects these two areas) is now between the agent's current position and their initial starting point. Therefore, relative to the initial direction of approach from the park, the agent is \"behind\" the bridge, having passed the landmark's primary function as a crossing point.\n\nThe provided answer is correct.",
