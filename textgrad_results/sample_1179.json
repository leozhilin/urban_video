  "ground_truth": "B",
  "textgrad_result": {
    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current location, as depicted in the final frames, is far from the bridge. The agent has moved through various parts of the city and is now positioned near a large body of water surrounded by buildings, indicating a significant distance from the initial bridge location.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 248)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video begins with a view of a city, and a large red suspension bridge becomes visible on the left side of the screen around the 0:09 mark. The navigation instructions describe a long sequence of movements, including flying over buildings and roads, and moving through different parts of the city. In the final frames of the video (from approximately 1:50 onwards, and especially from 2:20 to 2:48), the agent is positioned high above a large park with a prominent lake, looking out over a vast cityscape. The red suspension bridge is no longer visible in these final views, indicating that the agent has moved a significant distance away from its initial location near the bridge. Therefore, the agent's current location is far away from the bridge. The provided answer correctly identifies that the agent is far away from the bridge.",
