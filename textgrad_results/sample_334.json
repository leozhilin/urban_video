    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The initial position shows a view of the community entrance and surrounding buildings, but the parking space on the right is not visible within the current field of view. The perspective does not extend far enough to include the parking area.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1)]\nOption: D\nReason: At the initial position (00:00), the video displays a highly abstract, block-like representation of a city from a very high altitude. From this perspective, no specific community entrance, detailed buildings, or individual parking spaces are discernible. The view is too general and lacks the resolution to identify such a specific destination. Therefore, the parking space is not within sight.\n\nThe provided answer's option D is correct. However, its reason states, \"The initial position shows a view of the community entrance and surrounding buildings...\" This statement is inaccurate. The very initial position (00:00) does not show a detailed view of a community entrance or surrounding buildings; it presents a highly abstract city overview. Detailed views of the community only appear later in the video as the camera zooms in. Despite this inaccurate premise, the conclusion that the parking space is not visible from the initial viewpoint is correct.",
