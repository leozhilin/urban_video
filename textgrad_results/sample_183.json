  "question": "Question: What\u2019s the next step after you are aimed at the center of the street?  \nChoice: A. I descend slightly to capture a better view of the building.  \n           B. I turn right and fly towards the corridor.  \n           C. I continue to fly over a series of buildings by the sea.  \n           D. I hover in place for a period of time.  \n           E. I rise to get a wider view.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The sequence of images shows a continuous forward movement over a series of buildings by the sea, indicating that the next step after being aimed at the center of the street is to continue this trajectory.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1, 20), (1:20, 1:43)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video initially shows a high-angle view of a street by the sea. From approximately 0:05 to 1:20, the camera gradually descends and adjusts its orientation until it is aimed directly along the center of the street, with the sea on the left and buildings on the right. After reaching this alignment (around 1:20), the camera continues to fly forward along this trajectory, moving over the street and past a series of buildings that line the coast. This continuous forward movement along the street by the sea, passing buildings, directly supports option C. The provided answer is correct.",
    "feedback": null,
    "final_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The sequence of images shows a continuous forward movement over a series of buildings by the sea, indicating that the next step after being aimed at the center of the street is to continue this trajectory."
