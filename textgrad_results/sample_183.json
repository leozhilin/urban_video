  "question": "Question: What\u2019s the next step after you are aimed at the center of the street?  \nChoice: A. I descend slightly to capture a better view of the building.  \n           B. I turn right and fly towards the corridor.  \n           C. I continue to fly over a series of buildings by the sea.  \n           D. I hover in place for a period of time.  \n           E. I rise to get a wider view.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The sequence of images shows a continuous forward movement over a series of buildings by the sea, indicating that the next step is to continue this trajectory.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1, 20), (1, 40), (1, 150)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video initially shows the agent at a high altitude, then it descends and aligns itself with the street running alongside the sea and buildings. From approximately 1:15 onwards, the agent is clearly aimed at the center of the street. After this point, the agent continues to move forward along this street, which is bordered by buildings on one side and the sea on the other. This continuous forward movement along the street, past the buildings and by the sea, directly supports option C. The other options describe movements (descending, turning right, hovering, rising) that do not occur after the agent is aimed at the center of the street; instead, the agent maintains its forward trajectory.",
