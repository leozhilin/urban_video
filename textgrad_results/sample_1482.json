    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The sequence of images shows that the agent has flown over the park, as indicated by the aerial view of the park with trees and a pond in the foreground. This matches the instruction to \"fly on top of the park,\" confirming that the current position is directly over the park.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 102)]\nOption: C\nReason: The navigation instruction explicitly states \"fly on top of the park\". The video sequence from approximately 0:26 onwards clearly shows the agent flying at a high altitude, with the park (identifiable by its trees and a pond) directly below. The view is an aerial perspective looking down onto the park, confirming that the agent's current position is \"over the park\". The provided answer correctly identifies this and aligns with the visual evidence and the given instruction.",
