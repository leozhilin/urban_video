    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The images show a building with a grid-like pattern of windows at the corner of the street, which matches the description in option D. There are no visible blue roofs, advertising screens, parks with benches, or cafes with outdoor seating at the corners in the provided frames.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 4)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video frames from 00:00 to 00:04 show the agent approaching a street corner. On the left side of the street, at this corner, there is a prominent building. This building clearly features numerous windows arranged in a distinct grid-like pattern. Options A, B, C, and E are incorrect as there is no building with a blue roof, a large advertising screen, a park with several benches, or a caf\u00e9 with outdoor seating directly at the corner where the agent approaches. The provided answer correctly identifies the building with grid-like windows, which is the most accurate description of the street corner.",
