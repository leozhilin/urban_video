  "question": "Question: Which of the following options better summarizes your movement?  \nChoice:  \nA. I climb from the center line of the main road to the roof of a nearby building.  \nB. I move around various skyscrapers from above the city streets, facing the blue pyramid-shaped roofs.  \nC. I start from the street corner near the traffic light, follow the main road, face the roof, and climb to a position where I can observe the blue pyramid roof up close.  \nD. I descend from the traffic light along the road to the front of the building directly below the pyramid roof.  \nE. I move backward from the towering facade of a skyscraper and over a city street.

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The sequence of images shows a progression from a street corner near a traffic light, moving along the main road, and gradually ascending to a higher vantage point where the blue pyramid-shaped roof becomes prominently visible. This aligns with the description in option C, which mentions starting from the street corner, following the main road, and climbing to observe the blue pyramid roof up close.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 234)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video begins at a street corner (0:00-0:02) with a traffic light visible, looking down a main road. As the video progresses (0:02-0:50), the perspective moves along the main road, gradually ascending from street level to a higher vantage point. The blue pyramid-shaped roof, initially seen in the distance, becomes increasingly prominent and closer (0:50-1:28). Finally, the camera moves directly towards and then climbs the side of the building, bringing the blue pyramid roof into a very close view (1:28-2:34). This entire trajectory perfectly matches the description in Option C: \"I start from the street corner near the traffic light, follow the main road, face the roof, and climb to a position where I can observe the blue pyramid roof up close.\" The provided answer's reasoning is accurate and aligns with the visual evidence.",
