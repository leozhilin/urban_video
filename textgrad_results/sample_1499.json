Therefore, the correct answer is that the agent is far away from the pond.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 518)]\nOption: B\nReason: The navigation instructions clearly state \"fly over the pond and move forward to the red rockets building. now move towards between the buildings and turn right move towards the top of blue tower slow down to the tower. now turn left cross the bolt cola building and move forward behind grocery and dry building slow down and stay there.\" This sequence of movements indicates that the agent travels a considerable distance past and away from the pond. The video frames from approximately 2:30 onwards, showing a high-angle view of the city with the pond visible in the far distance, confirm that the agent's current location is indeed far away from the pond. The provided answer is correct.",
