    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The initial position shows a view of tall buildings and streets, but there is no visible balcony on the 12th floor within the current field of view. The perspective is too distant or angled in such a way that specific details like a balcony are not discernible.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 21)]\nOption: D\nReason: At the initial position (00:00-00:01), the view is primarily of the upper parts of very tall buildings and the sky. As the camera pans down (00:01-00:21), it reveals the street level and the side of a building with floor numbers. However, the visible floor numbers start from 31 and go downwards, indicating the camera's high vantage point. The 12th floor would be significantly below the lowest visible floors in the frame. Therefore, a balcony on the 12th floor is not within the current field of view. The provided answer correctly identifies that the destination is not within sight and provides a valid reason for this.",
