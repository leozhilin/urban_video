  "question": "Question: Which of the following options best summarizes your flight path to the green delivery locker?  \nChoice:  \nA. I start above the school runway, move upward and backward, turn right toward the parking lot between the two buildings, descend to the parking lot level, move forward to the parking lot, and finally position myself on the green delivery above the cabinet.  \nB. I start from the garden, fly directly to the parking lot, and then descend to the green distribution cabinet.  \nC. I start from above a modern building, fly over the runway, and then descend to the green distribution cabinet.  \nD. I start from above the school runway, rise to a high altitude, then adjust my perspective upward and turn left, face the roof of the white building on the left, turn right and fly over the parking lot between the two buildings, look down at the edge of the parking lot, turn right to align with the green one in a row of delivery lockers, and finally descend diagonally above the delivery lockers.  \nE. I start from the parking lot, move up, and then turn right to find the green delivery cabinet.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The flight path described in option D accurately matches the sequence of movements observed in the video frames. It starts above the school runway, rises to a high altitude, adjusts perspective upward, turns left to face the roof of the white building, then turns right to fly over the parking lot between two buildings, looks down at the edge of the parking lot, turns right to align with the green delivery locker, and finally descends diagonally above the delivery lockers. This detailed sequence is consistent with the visual journey captured in the frames provided.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 2), (26, 31), (34, 40), (155, 157), (159, 161), (200, 202), (204, 206)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video starts above the school runway (0-2s). Then the view moves upward and backward (26-31s), turns left to face the roof of the white building on the left (34-40s), turns right and flies over the parking lot between the two buildings (155-157s), looks down at the edge of the parking lot (159-161s), turns right to align with the green one in a row of delivery lockers (200-202s), and finally descends diagonally above the delivery lockers (204-206s). Therefore, option D is the best answer.",
