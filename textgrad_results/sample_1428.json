  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [Passing through several buildings in front of agent, see a lake and fly over the bridge in the middle of the lake]. You move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I rise and then fly forward.  \nB. I descend and turn left.  \nC. I fly forward.  \nD. I turn right and go up.  \nE. I fly forward as I rise.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The navigation instruction requires passing through several buildings in front of the agent. Currently, the agent is positioned in front of a cluster of tall buildings. To proceed with the instruction, the best next step is to fly forward, which aligns with moving towards and potentially between the buildings as required by the instruction. Options involving turning or rising specifically are not indicated as necessary at this stage based on the given instruction.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 14)]\nOption: C\nReason: The navigation instruction explicitly states to \"pass through several buildings in front of agent\". The video shows the agent is currently positioned directly in front of a cluster of tall buildings. To initiate the process of \"passing through\" these buildings, the most direct and logical next step is to fly forward. The current altitude appears suitable for beginning this movement. There is no visual evidence or part of the instruction that suggests the need to rise, descend, or turn before proceeding forward. Therefore, \"fly forward\" is the most appropriate immediate action. The provided answer's reasoning is correct and aligns with this analysis.",
