    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"take off and turn little left and get high and move forward towards the buildings.\" The first frame shows a ground-level view, suggesting the starting point. The subsequent frames depict an ascent and a slight left turn, aligning with the instruction to get high and move towards the buildings. Therefore, the action described in option A matches the beginning of the navigation instructions.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15)]\nOption: [A]\nReason: The video starts with a ground-level view, and the camera ascends and turns slightly to the left. This aligns with the initial instruction to \"take off and turn little left and get high and move forward towards the buildings.\" Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",
