    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The current location, as described in the navigation instructions and visualized in the final frames, is near a brown building after moving through various landmarks including the sea, buildings, trees, and roads. The pond was last mentioned earlier in the sequence and is not in the immediate vicinity of the final position, indicating that the agent is far away from the pond.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(01:40, 02:57)]\nOption: [D]\nReason: The video shows the pond is far away from the brown building. The navigation instruction also indicates that the agent needs to move forward to the roads and take little right and move to the brown building. So the pond is far away from the current location.",
