    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The agent rises after aligning with the tower to capture the sunset view of the skyline, as indicated by the progression of frames showing a focus on the sunset and the expansive view from a higher vantage point.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:10, 0:54)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video shows the agent continuously rising, especially after being aligned with the tall tower (around 0:10). This continued ascent elevates the viewpoint significantly, providing an increasingly expansive and unobstructed panoramic view of the distant horizon where the sun is low, casting reflections on the water. This visual evidence strongly suggests the purpose of rising is to capture a grand, unobstructed \"sunset view of the skyline\" (referring to the horizon where the sky meets the sea and distant city). The progression of frames clearly emphasizes the sun and the vastness of the view from a higher vantage point.",
