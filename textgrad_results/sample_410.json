    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"take off and look at the sea,\" which implies that the agent should start by flying forward while rising to get a view of the sea. This matches option C, which suggests flying forward while rising.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 10)]\nOption: [C]\nReason: The instruction is to \"take off and look at the sea\". From the initial position (0-10s), the agent needs to fly forward and rise to get a better view of the sea. Therefore, the best next step is to fly forward while rising.",
