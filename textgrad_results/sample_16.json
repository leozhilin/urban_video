  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [fly up over the power lines and turn left. go to the short building across the channel. fly up and go to the top of the tallest building ahead. turn right and look down. turn back forward and go to the similar sized building across the channel. fly down to the ground and turn left. go to the end of the channel and go behind the trees. go to the left towards the open area. go to the tan coloured apartments and land on the ground.]. You move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is your best next step?  \nchoose:  \nA. I rise and then fly forward.  \nB. I go forward and turn left.  \nC. I fly forward while descending.  \nD. I turn right and go up.  \nE. I rotate the camera downward and then lower it.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The next step in the navigation instruction is to \"turn right and look down,\" which suggests that the agent should rotate the camera downward to observe the environment below, aligning with option E.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:50, 1:40)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instruction states, \"...fly up and go to the top of the tallest building ahead. **turn right and look down.** turn back forward and go to the similar sized building across the channel...\". At approximately 0:59 in the video, the agent has successfully reached the top of the tallest building. The immediate next instruction is \"turn right and look down.\" The video then shows the agent turning right (from 1:00 to 1:15) and subsequently rotating the camera downward (from 1:15 to 1:40), followed by a descent (from 1:40 onwards). Option E, \"I rotate the camera downward and then lower it,\" accurately describes the \"look down\" action (rotating the camera downward) and the logical subsequent action of lowering the agent, which is consistent with preparing for the next instruction \"fly down to the ground\" (though not explicitly stated in the current instruction, it's implied by looking down from a height in a navigation context). Among the given choices, Option E is the best fit for the \"look down\" part of the instruction and the observed actions in the video. The provided answer's reasoning is correct and aligns with this analysis.",
