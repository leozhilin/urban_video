    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current location is directly above the track and field, providing a clear and unobstructed view of the entire area, including the gymnastics horizontal bar. This perspective indicates that the agent is far above the track and field, directly above the gymnastics horizontal bar.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 51)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video is captured from a high aerial perspective, like a drone. From this \"far above\" vantage point, the entire track and field, including the gymnastics horizontal bar (visible on the right side of the track from approximately 0:39 onwards), is clearly visible and unobstructed. The camera is positioned directly above the general area of the track and field, providing an overhead view of the destination. Therefore, the agent's current location is far above the track and field, with the gymnastics horizontal bar directly below in its field of view. The provided answer correctly identifies this perspective.",
