  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [Take off, rise, and go left over the flat roof. Fly straight to the building with a lady on a billboard, then veer right and continue straight. Head to the yellow billboard, make a half right turn, and fly over the fountain towards the trees. Fly over the treetops, veer right towards the road between buildings, then take a near full left turn over trees until you see water. Rise near a tree, turn right until you see four buildings, then go straight to the car banner. Fly between the banner and building, continue straight, veer left of the high-rise, then a bit right. Descend to see a 5-story building, turn left, rise above it, and make a half left turn. Fly right of the car banner building to see the skyline, then turn left slightly and fly high over the trees.]. At the initial position, you are asked to navigate based on a series of movement instructions. What is your Landmark Position from the fountain when you reach the current location?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am to the right of the fountain.  \nB. I stay away from the fountain.  \nC. I am located below the fountain.  \nD. I am located on the left side of the fountain.  \nE. I am behind the fountain.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current location, as depicted in the frames, shows a view of the cityscape with no immediate proximity to the fountain. The agent has moved past the fountain and is now observing the skyline and other landmarks from a distance, indicating that they are staying away from the fountain.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1, 3), (127, 130), (305, 311)]\nOption: B\nReason: The navigation instructions state, \"fly over the fountain towards the trees.\" This event occurs around the 1:28 mark in the video, where the agent is clearly seen flying directly over a fountain in a park. Following this, the instructions detail several more movements, including flying over treetops, veering right, taking a near full left turn, rising, turning right, going straight to a car banner, flying between a banner and building, veering left of a high-rise, descending, turning left, rising above a 5-story building, making a half left turn, and finally flying right of the car banner building to see the skyline, then turning left slightly and flying high over the trees. At the end of the video (from 3:05 onwards), the agent is high above the city, and the fountain is visible far below and to the right, in the distance. The agent has moved significantly away from the fountain since passing over it. Therefore, the most accurate description of the agent's landmark position from the fountain at the current location is that they are staying away from it. The provided answer is correct.",
