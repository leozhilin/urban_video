    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The current view shows that the agent is flying above a parking lot on the right front, which matches the final instruction in the series of movement instructions.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:48, 1:54)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video begins with the agent flying up and forward. However, the instructions \"Reach the second intersection on the left\" and \"Turn left and fly forward\" are not observed in the video. Instead, after flying forward for a significant duration, the agent turns right (around 1:30) and in the final frames (from 1:48 onwards), the agent is clearly flying above a parking lot, which is consistent with the final instruction: \"Finally fly above the parking lot on the right front.\" Therefore, the current move depicted at the end of the video matches option D. The provided answer is correct.",
