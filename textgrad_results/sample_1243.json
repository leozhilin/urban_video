    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The current location shows a view of a parking lot with buildings around, and the red teaching building is visible to the north. Therefore, the direction to the destination (the roof of the red teaching building) from the current location is north, making the agent currently located south of the red teaching building, near a parking lot.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 53)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video starts by showing a close-up of a grey building, then pans out to reveal the surrounding area. From approximately 0:35 onwards, a red building, identified as the \"red teaching building,\" becomes clearly visible in the mid-left of the frame. This red building is situated to the north (or slightly northwest) of the agent's current position. The agent's current location is above or very near a large parking lot, which is clearly visible from 0:10 onwards, adjacent to the grey building. Therefore, the agent is currently located south of the red teaching building, near a parking lot. The provided answer is consistent with this analysis.",
