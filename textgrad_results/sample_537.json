    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The current perspective shows a high-altitude view above the intersection, indicating that the agent is located above the intersection at a very high altitude.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 125)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video begins with a view from an elevated position, looking down at a street and buildings. As the video progresses, the camera pans left and ascends significantly, revealing a vast urban landscape from a bird's-eye perspective. Around the 0:55 mark, a large intersection becomes clearly visible far below the camera's position. The continuous upward movement and wide panoramic view confirm that the agent's current location is at a very high altitude, looking down upon the intersection and the surrounding city. Therefore, the agent is located above the intersection at a very high altitude. The provided answer is correct and aligns with the visual evidence.",
