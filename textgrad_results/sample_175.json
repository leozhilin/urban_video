  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [take off the drone, go straight. turn left, move towards the tree side area. reach beyond the tallest building. then move towards the chocolate shop. dive in the land near daves car shop. take left move toward the sea side. again take left to reach the destination and then land off the drone.]. At the initial position, you are asked to navigate according to a series of movement instructions. When you reach the current location, what is your Landmark Position relative to the tallest building?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am located to the left of the tallest building.  \nB. I am located to the right of the tallest building.  \nC. I am located below the tallest building.  \nD. I am positioned above the tallest building.  \nE. I am at the same level as the tallest building.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The current view shows that the agent is positioned above the tallest building, as indicated by the perspective looking down at the surrounding structures and the cityscape. This aligns with the instruction to \"reach beyond the tallest building,\" suggesting an elevated position.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 113)]\nOption: D\nReason: The navigation instruction states \"take off the drone\" at the initial position, indicating the agent will ascend. Subsequently, the instruction \"reach beyond the tallest building\" implies that the agent should not only pass the building horizontally but also potentially gain an elevated position relative to it. From approximately 0:15 onwards, the video shows the agent's perspective gradually rising, and by 0:35, the view is clearly from a high altitude, looking down at the entire cityscape, including the building that appears to be the tallest. This elevated perspective, where the agent is looking down at the tallest building and other structures, confirms that the agent is positioned above the tallest building. The provided answer is consistent with this observation and the given instructions.",
