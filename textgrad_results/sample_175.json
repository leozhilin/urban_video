  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [take off the drone, go straight. turn left, move towards the tree side area. reach beyond the tallest building. then move towards the chocolate shop. dive in the land near daves car shop. take left move toward the sea side. again take left to reach the destination and then land off the drone.]. At the initial position, you are asked to navigate according to a series of movement instructions. When you reach the current location, what is your Landmark Position relative to the tallest building?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am located to the left of the tallest building.  \nB. I am located to the right of the tallest building.  \nC. I am located below the tallest building.  \nD. I am positioned above the tallest building.  \nE. I am at the same level as the tallest building.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The current view shows that the agent is positioned above the tallest building, as indicated by the perspective looking down at the buildings and the surrounding area. This aligns with the instruction to \"reach beyond the tallest building,\" suggesting an elevated position.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 113)]\nOption: D\nReason: The navigation instruction states \"take off the drone\" and then \"reach beyond the tallest building.\" The video clearly shows the drone ascending from ground level (0:00-0:29) to a high altitude (0:30-1:13). From 0:30 onwards, the agent's perspective is from above the city, looking down at the buildings and the landscape. The tallest building in the distance is visible, but the agent is clearly at a significantly higher elevation, looking down upon it and the entire city. This visual evidence, combined with the instruction to \"reach beyond the tallest building,\" strongly indicates that the agent is positioned above it. The provided answer is correct.",
