    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The agent is navigating towards the building with the 'CEM' sign, and based on the aerial perspective shown in the images, the most logical next action is to fly forward to continue approaching the target building. The sequence of images indicates forward movement through the urban environment, making \"Fly forward\" the appropriate choice.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 22)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video provides an aerial perspective of the environment. At approximately 0:21-0:22, the building marked with 'CEM' is clearly visible. Given the objective to navigate to this building from the current aerial vantage point, the most direct and logical action to approach it is to \"Fly forward\". While the video itself primarily shows camera panning and rotation rather than continuous forward translational movement of the agent, \"Fly forward\" is the appropriate action to initiate movement towards the identified target building. The provided answer's reasoning that \"The sequence of images indicates forward movement through the urban environment\" is inaccurate, as the video mainly demonstrates a surveying motion (panning) rather than a consistent forward trajectory. However, the selected option \"C. Fly forward\" is correct for the stated navigation goal.",
