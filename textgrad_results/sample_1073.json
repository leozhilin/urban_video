    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current position appears to be above the city with a clear view of the buildings and roads below. According to the navigation instruction, the next step involves stopping near the billboard on the roof across the road and lowering down a bit. Therefore, flying forward and descending aligns with approaching the specified location and preparing to lower down as instructed.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(4:30, 4:38)]\nOption: B\nReason: The navigation instruction states: \"fly forward to the next road ahead. stop near the billboard on the roof across the road and lower down a bit.\" At the 4:30 mark, the agent has just completed the \"turn left\" instruction and is now facing the direction of the \"next road ahead\" and the building with the billboard. To reach this location and fulfill the instruction to \"lower down a bit,\" the agent must both fly forward and descend. Option B, \"I fly forward and descend,\" accurately combines these two necessary actions to proceed towards and settle at the specified target. The provided answer's reasoning is correct and aligns with the visual evidence and the given instructions.",
