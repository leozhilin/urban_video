    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The current view shows that the agent is at the same height as the fifth-floor balcony and slightly farther away, as indicated by the alignment with the fifth floor's windows and balcony.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:17, 1:55)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video shows the agent descending along the side of a tall building with floor numbers marked on it. From approximately 1:17 to 1:55, the number '5' is clearly visible and centered in the view, indicating that the agent is currently at the height of the fifth floor. The fifth-floor balcony is also visible at this level. Since the agent is viewing the building from the outside, they are at the same height as the target balcony but not directly on it, thus \"slightly farther away\" is an accurate description of the horizontal distance. The provided answer correctly identifies this relative position.",
