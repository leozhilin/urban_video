    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The navigation instructions lead to a position in front of the billboard, and based on the final frames, the agent is positioned to the left of the building with the billboard on the right side. This aligns with option A, indicating the agent is to the left of the billboard.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(2:55, 3:45)]\nOption: A\nReason: The navigation instructions lead the agent to \"land in front of billboard\" after going \"beside that building\" (the second tall building on the left). In the final frames of the video, from approximately 2:55 onwards, the agent is positioned high above a park, looking towards the city skyline. A prominent billboard is visible on the roof of a building located on the right side of the agent's field of view (e.g., clearly seen at 2:45, and remaining on the right throughout the final segment). If the agent is \"in front of\" this billboard, meaning facing it, and the billboard itself is observed to be on the right side of the agent's perspective, then the agent's physical location must be to the left of that billboard. Therefore, the agent is located to the left of the billboard of the building on the right. The provided answer's reasoning aligns with this observation and interpretation.",
