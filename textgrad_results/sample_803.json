    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The descent towards the street level appears to be a quick, direct movement, while maneuvering between the buildings involves navigating through a more complex environment with multiple turns and adjustments, which likely takes more time.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 4), (27, 32)]\nOption: B\nReason: From 0 to 4 seconds, the video shows a descent from a high altitude to a lower altitude, but not all the way to street level. From 27 to 32 seconds, the video shows the agent maneuvering between buildings. The maneuvering between buildings appears to take longer than the initial descent. Therefore, my descent towards the street level takes shorter than my maneuvering between the buildings.",
