At the initial position, you are asked to navigate according to a series of movement instructions. What are you doing now?  \nchoose:  \nA. I turn right at the building.  \nB. I fly forward and gradually descend.  \nC. I turn right until the edge of the pool and the trees appear in the right view.  \nD. I go across the water.  \nE. I take off and turn right.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"take off and turn right,\" which matches the action described in option E. The subsequent frames show a view consistent with having taken off and turned right, as the edge of the swimming pool and trees come into the right side view.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 20)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instruction given at the initial position explicitly states to \"take off and turn right until the edge of swimming pool and trees is on the right side view.\" From the very beginning of the video (around 0:01), the agent starts to ascend (take off) and simultaneously rotates to the right. By 0:04, the rightward turn is clearly visible, and the swimming pool and trees begin to enter the right side of the view, confirming that the agent is actively performing the \"take off and turn right\" action as per the initial instruction. The provided answer correctly identifies this action.",
