  "question": "Question: After you move forward, how does the distance to the intersection change?  \nChoice: A. I increase the distance to the intersection.  \n           B. The distance to the intersection remains unchanged.  \n           C. I decrease the distance to the intersection.  ",
  "question_category": "Proximity",
  "ground_truth": "C",
  "textgrad_result": {
    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: As the agent moves forward, the view transitions from a close-up of buildings to a broader street scene with visible intersections. This indicates that the agent is approaching the intersection, thus decreasing the distance to it.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 32)]\nOption: [C]\nReason: From 0 to 32 seconds, the agent moves forward, and the intersection becomes more and more clear. So the distance to the intersection decreases.",

    "final_answer": "Option: C; Reason: As the agent moves forward, the view transitions from a close-up of buildings to a broader street scene with visible intersections. This indicates that the agent is approaching the intersection, thus decreasing the distance to it."
