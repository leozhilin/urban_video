    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The current view shows the entrance of the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, indicating that the agent has reached the destination.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(2:00, 2:39)]\nOption: A\nReason: The video begins with an aerial view and gradually descends. From approximately 2:00 onwards, the camera is positioned directly above the entrance of the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, with the bank's name \"\u4e0a\u6d77\u6d66\u4e1c\u53d1\u5c55\u94f6\u884c SPD BANK\" clearly visible on the ground. This indicates that the agent has successfully navigated to and reached the specified destination, which is the bank entrance. Therefore, the current location *is* the destination. Option A, \"I am currently located inside the entrance of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank,\" best describes having arrived at the destination, implying the task is complete and the agent is at the target location. While the camera is technically \"above\" the entrance, \"inside\" in this context refers to being at the designated entry point, which is the goal of the navigation. The other options (B, C, D) describe locations far from or incorrectly oriented to the destination, which is contradicted by the final frames of the video.",
