    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"take off and turn right and fly over the trees and cross towards the grass.\" The first frame shows a ground-level view, and subsequent frames indicate an ascent and a turn to the right, aligning with the instruction to fly over the trees toward the grass. Therefore, the correct action at the initial position is to turn right and fly over the trees toward the grass.",
    "evaluation": "Okay, I will analyze the video and the provided answer, and provide my evaluation in the specified format.\n\nLocation: [(0, 10)]\nOption: [D]\nReason: The video starts with a ground-level view (0-1s). From 1s to 10s, the camera ascends and turns to the right. This movement aligns with the initial instruction: \"take off and turn right and fly over the trees and cross towards the grass.\" The visual evidence supports the action of turning right and flying over the trees towards the grass. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n",
