    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The current view shows a park-like area with water and trees, which aligns with the instruction to \"finish at the park.\" Since the next step after the park is \"back to the bridge over the water,\" and there's no immediate indication of a bridge in the current frames, it suggests that the action of going to the Coca-Cola cap and making a right (which would lead towards the park) has been completed. Therefore, the most fitting option is C, as it represents a step that logically precedes arriving at the park.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 50)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video shows a park with a lake and a bridge in the distance. The instructions were: \"fly through the medal bars at the beginning. fly down to the tree in the center of the water. make a stop at the bridge over the water. go to the car wash bill board and make a left. go to the coca cola cap and make a right. finish at the park. back to the bridge over the water.\" Since the view is of the park, and the bridge is in the distance, it is likely that the agent has already gone to the Coca-Cola cap and made a right turn, which would lead towards the park. Therefore, the most fitting option is C. The provided answer is correct.\n",
