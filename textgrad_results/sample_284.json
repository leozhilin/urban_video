    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The initial position does not show the largest intersection within the field of view. The frames provided depict various parts of the city, including buildings and roads, but the largest intersection is not visible from the starting point.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15)]\nOption: D\nReason: The initial frames (0:00-0:15) show a street-level view of buildings and a road with parked cars. The camera's perspective is limited to the immediate surroundings. A large intersection, which becomes visible later in the video from an aerial perspective (e.g., around 1:47 onwards), is not within the field of view at the initial ground-level position. The provided answer correctly states that the largest intersection is not within sight from the current location.",
