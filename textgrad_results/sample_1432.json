  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [take off and turn slightly right and then turn slightly left towards a brown building. fly forward and turn right towards a white building when above an intersection. fly forward and land in front of a light pole.]. You move according to a series of movement instructions. What are you doing now?  \nchoose:  \nA. I fly forward and land in front of the light pole.  \nB. When above the road, I fly forward towards the white building.  \nC. I take off and turn slightly to the right, then slightly to the left, toward a brown building.  \nD. I turn back.  \nE. I fly forward.",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The agent is currently above the road and moving forward towards a white building, which aligns with the instruction to \"fly forward towards the white building when above an intersection.\" The presence of the intersection and the direction towards the white building in the frames supports this choice.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 20)]\nOption: B\nReason: The navigation instruction states: \"take off and turn slightly right and then turn slightly left towards a brown building. fly forward and turn right towards a white building when above an intersection. fly forward and land in front of a light pole.\"\n\nFrom 00:00 to approximately 00:09, the agent takes off and maneuvers, initially orienting towards a brown building. Around 00:09-00:10, the agent is clearly positioned above an intersection. From 00:10 onwards, the agent begins to fly forward and turn right, with a prominent white building becoming the clear target in the direction of movement. By 00:20, the agent is actively flying forward and turning towards this white building, having passed over the intersection. This directly corresponds to the instruction \"fly forward and turn right towards a white building when above an intersection.\" Therefore, option B accurately describes the agent's current action.\n\nThe provided answer is correct and aligns with this analysis. The agent is indeed above the road (specifically, an intersection) and moving forward towards the white building, executing the second part of the given navigation instruction.",
