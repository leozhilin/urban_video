    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The agent is navigating towards the vicinity of the tower crane at the construction site. Given the next steps for the street next to the construction site, the most logical action is to fly forward to approach the crane directly. This aligns with the goal of reaching the vicinity of the tower crane.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 41)]\nOption: C\nReason: The objective is to navigate to the vicinity of the tower crane at the construction site ahead. From the initial position, the tower crane is clearly visible in the distance, straight ahead. The video demonstrates the agent's movement, particularly from approximately 0:10 onwards, where the camera steadily moves forward and zooms in, bringing the construction site and the tower crane into closer view. This action directly corresponds to \"flying forward\" to approach the target. Therefore, flying forward is the most logical and direct next step to achieve the stated navigation goal. The provided answer is correct.",
