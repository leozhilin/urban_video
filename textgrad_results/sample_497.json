    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The sequence of images shows the agent starting at a lower vantage point within the city streets and gradually ascending to a higher position above the urban grid. The agent then turns towards a curved road near the water, which aligns with the description in option B.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15), (35, 42), (119, 130)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video starts with a street-level view in a city. As the video progresses, the viewpoint ascends, providing a broader view of the urban landscape. By the end of the video, the view is high above the city, overlooking a curved road near the water. This aligns with option B, which describes ascending from the ground floor to a high point and turning toward a curved road near the water.",
