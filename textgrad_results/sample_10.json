  "question": "Question: If you do not fly directly to the building with the green mesh balcony, but choose to fly over the intersection first, can you still reach your destination, and how does the route compare?\n\nChoice: A. If I fly above the intersection first, I can still reach the destination, but the route will be significantly longer.  \n           B. If I fly over the intersection first, I can still reach the destination, and the route length is about the same.  \n           C. If I fly over the intersection first, I will be blocked by other buildings and cannot reach my destination.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: Flying over the intersection first does not significantly alter the overall distance to the destination. The route remains feasible and the length is approximately the same as directly heading to the building with the green mesh balcony.",

Flying over the intersection first would not be blocked by other buildings, and the route length would be approximately the same as flying directly to the building.",
