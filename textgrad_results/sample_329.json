    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The initial position shows a view of the cityscape and buildings, but there is no visible balcony on the 22nd floor within the current field of view. The focus is more on the general urban environment rather than specific details like balconies.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1)]\nOption: D\nReason: At the initial position (00:00), the camera's field of view shows a general cityscape with several tall buildings. However, there is no identifiable balcony on the 22nd floor of any building within this initial view. The video later pans down a specific building (from approximately 00:08 onwards) where floor numbers become visible, but this is not the \"initial position\" view. Therefore, at the initial position, the 22nd-floor balcony is not within sight. The provided answer is correct.",
