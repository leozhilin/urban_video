    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The sequence of images shows a view from above rooftops towards a park area, where a series of large trees are visible along with a lake. Additionally, the city skyline is prominently reflected in the water, matching the description in option E.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 58)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video begins by showing a building from street level and then ascends, revealing a cityscape. As the camera continues to rise and move forward (from approximately 0:15 onwards), a large body of water, clearly identifiable as a lake, comes into view. This lake is bordered by a series of large trees, indicating a park area. Beyond the lake, a prominent city skyline is visible, and its reflection is clearly seen in the water, especially from 0:25 to the end of the video. Therefore, option E accurately describes the objects observed while flying over the rooftops toward the park. The provided answer is correct and aligns with the visual evidence.",
