At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is your best next step?  \nchoose:  \nA. I go up and turn left.  \nB. I turn right and fly forward.  \nC. I fly forward and rotate the camera downward.  \nD. I turn right and go up.  \nE. I turn left and descend.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The navigation instruction starts with \"fly up over the power lines and turn left,\" which directly corresponds to option A, indicating that the first action should be to go up and then turn left.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 5)]\nOption: A\nReason: The navigation instruction explicitly states the first action as \"fly up over the power lines and turn left.\" Option A, \"I go up and turn left,\" directly corresponds to this initial instruction. The video from 0:00 to 0:05 shows the agent starting from the ground level and moving upwards, passing over the power lines, which aligns with the \"fly up over the power lines\" part of the instruction. The subsequent \"turn left\" is the next immediate action required. The provided answer is correct.",
