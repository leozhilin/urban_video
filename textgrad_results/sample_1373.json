    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The initial frames show a wide urban scene with multiple high-rise buildings, but no short building with a yellow exterior wall is visible. The most prominent feature in the lower part of the field of view is an intersection with roads and vehicles, making option D the most relevant.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 5)]\nOption: D\nReason: At the initial position (0:00-0:05), the video displays a wide urban landscape dominated by numerous tall buildings. There is no \"very short building with a yellow exterior wall\" visible within the field of view. The most prominent and clearly identifiable feature in the lower part of the initial frame is a large, busy intersection with multiple roads and vehicles, which serves as a significant landmark. This aligns with option D. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with this observation.",
