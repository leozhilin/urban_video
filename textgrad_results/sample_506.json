    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The next step in the navigation instruction is to \"view the single tree near by water area then view water area from the top of the tree.\" To achieve this, flying forward and then rising would allow the agent to reach the top of the tree and get a clear view of the water area from an elevated position.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:10, 1:55)]\nOption: A\nReason: The current position in the video (around 1:10) shows the agent having just viewed the traffic lights on the road. The next instruction is \"then go straight and view the single tree near by water area then view water area from the top of the tree.\" To fulfill this instruction, the agent first needs to \"go straight\" towards the tree and water area, which is achieved by flying forward (seen from 1:10 to approximately 1:50). Once near the tree and water, the instruction requires viewing the \"water area from the top of the tree,\" which necessitates rising to an elevated position. This rising movement is observed in the video from approximately 1:50 to 1:55, where the agent ascends to get a clear, elevated view of the water. Therefore, \"I fly forward and then rise\" accurately describes the necessary next steps to follow the navigation instruction. The provided answer is correct.",
