    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The sequence of images shows a direct ascent from the street level to a high position outside the 14th floor of a building, without any indication of starting from a park, descending, or moving horizontally. Therefore, option D accurately describes the trajectory.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 49)]\nOption: [D]\nReason: The video shows the camera starting at street level and directly ascending to the 14th floor of the target building. There is no evidence of starting from a park, descending from a high-rise, or moving horizontally. Therefore, option D is the most accurate description of the trajectory. The provided answer is correct.\n",
