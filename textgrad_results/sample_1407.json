    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The initial position shows a view of the building's exterior with floors labeled up to 14, but there is no visible balcony on the 14th floor or any indication of a balcony within the current field of view. The perspective is from a distance and does not provide a close-up view of the 14th floor details.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1)]\nOption: D\nReason: At the initial position (00:00-00:01), the video displays a wide, distant view of a city skyline featuring a tall, rectangular building. From this perspective, it is impossible to discern individual floors or identify any specific features like balconies on the 14th floor. The building shown at the initial position does not appear to have prominent balconies. Therefore, the destination is not within sight. The provided answer's reason incorrectly states that \"floors labeled up to 14\" are visible at the initial position; these floor labels only become visible on a different, rounder building later in the video (from approximately 00:11 onwards, with the 14th floor label appearing around 00:47).",
