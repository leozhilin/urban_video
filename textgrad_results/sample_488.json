    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The sequence of images shows a progression from ground level to an aerial view above the buildings, indicating that the agent is flying over the buildings. This aligns with the navigation instruction to \"get up and turn right towards the ash building,\" suggesting an elevated movement, and the subsequent frames confirm this by showing a bird's-eye view of the cityscape.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 3), (3, 10), (10, 22)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video starts with a ground-level view of a building (0-3s). Then, the camera gradually moves upwards, showing a wider view of the cityscape and other buildings (3-10s). By 10-22s, the camera is clearly above the buildings, providing a bird's-eye view of the city, including a pond in the distance. This upward movement indicates that the agent is flying over the buildings. The navigation instruction \"get up and turn right towards the ash building\" also supports this.",
