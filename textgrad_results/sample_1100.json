    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The goal is to navigate to the balcony on the 23rd floor. Based on the sequence of images, the agent is currently observing the building from an external perspective and can see the floors labeled. To reach the 23rd floor, the agent should approach the height corresponding to that floor level. Therefore, approaching the height of 23 floors is the logical next step.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 47)]\nOption: C\nReason: The question asks to navigate to the balcony on the 23rd floor. The video frames show a tall building with floor numbers clearly visible on its exterior, ranging from the 31st floor down to the 23rd floor and below. The agent's perspective shifts from a general city view to a close-up, downward view of this specific building, highlighting the floor numbers. To reach the 23rd floor balcony, the most direct and logical next action is to approach the specific height corresponding to the 23rd floor, which is clearly marked and visible in the video, especially from 0:25 onwards. The provided answer correctly identifies this as the next logical step.",
