    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The green-screen balcony of the high-rise building across the road on the left is not within the field of view in the initial position. The frames provided do not show a green-screen balcony in the lower left corner, center, upper right corner, or right side of the field of view. Therefore, the destination is not visible from the current location.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1)]\nOption: C\nReason: At the initial position (0:00-0:01), the camera is facing a general street view with multiple high-rise buildings across the road. The video then proceeds to pan significantly to the right and zoom in on a specific building. The green-screen balcony, which is clearly visible from approximately 1:15 onwards, is located on a building that is not within the field of view at the very beginning of the video. The initial view is directed more towards the left side of the overall scene, and the green-screen balcony is revealed only after the camera pans extensively to the right and zooms in. Therefore, the destination is not within sight at the initial location. The provided answer correctly identifies this.",
