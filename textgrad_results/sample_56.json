    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 8)]\nOption: E\nReason: At the initial position (00:00), the agent is looking straight ahead at a city street. The question asks to navigate to \"the green trees behind the bus stop.\" By observing the video from 00:05 to 00:08, the camera pans to the right and slightly downwards, revealing a bus stop on the left side of the road. Behind this bus stop, across the road, are green trees. This indicates that from the initial perspective, the target location (green trees behind the bus stop) is situated to the right of the agent's current forward view. Therefore, to navigate towards this target, the appropriate next move is to turn right. The provided answer correctly identifies that the target is to the right and that turning right is the correct next move.",
