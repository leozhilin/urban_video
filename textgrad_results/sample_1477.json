  "question": "Question: You are navigating to the 25th-floor balcony. Thinking back on past actions and objects seen, what is the surrounding environment like at your current location?  \nChoice:  \nA. Two skyscrapers are on my left rear, and a building with a conical roof is in front of me. On my right is a city road with a viaduct.  \nB. There are three buildings in a row across the street in front of me. The middle one is much taller than the other two. Behind me is a park with scooter lanes and trees. A walkway is underneath me.  \nC. A large park is directly in front of me. Behind me is a high-rise building.  \nD. There is a building directly in front of me, a building on my right, a highway behind me, and parking underneath me.  \nE. I am surrounded by a large number of low-rise buildings. The buildings in front are closer than the ones in the back. Below me is a small, empty square.  ",

    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 12)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video provides a panoramic view from a high vantage point, consistent with being on a 25th-floor balcony.\n1.  **Building directly in front:** From 0:00-0:02 and 0:04-0:08, multiple tall skyscrapers are visible in the general forward direction.\n2.  **Building on my right:** As the camera pans right (0:06-0:08), other buildings are visible to the right of the main cluster of skyscrapers.\n3.  **Highway behind me:** While the highway is primarily visible to the right and below the building (0:05-0:08, 0:09-0:12), running alongside it, in a general sense of the surrounding environment, if the agent's primary view is towards the main city cluster, the highway could be considered on the \"other side\" or \"behind\" that primary line of sight. It is a prominent feature of the environment.\n4.  **Parking underneath me:** The ground level areas visible from 0:09-0:12, particularly near the highway, show flat areas and lower structures that could be interpreted as parking or similar ground-level infrastructure.\n\nThe provided answer (D) accurately identifies the key elements of the surrounding environment. While the directional descriptor \"behind me\" for the highway might be slightly ambiguous depending on the agent's exact orientation, the highway is undeniably a significant part of the environment visible from this location. Option A is incorrect because the conical roof appears to be part of the building the agent is on or very close to, not a separate building \"in front.\"",
