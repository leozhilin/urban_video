    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The sequence of images shows a continuous movement along the bridge, passing through multiple arches from the starting point to the middle of the bridge deck. This aligns with option C, which describes moving from the starting point of the suspension bridge to the middle of the bridge deck. The other options involve specific actions like flying or ascending that are not evident in the frames provided.",
