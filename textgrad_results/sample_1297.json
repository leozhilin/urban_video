    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The initial frames show a rooftop view with no playground in sight. The playground only becomes visible later as the perspective changes, indicating it is not within the field of view at the initial position.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 2)]\nOption: D\nReason: At the initial position (0:00), the camera is looking directly down at the rooftop. The playground, which becomes visible on the left side of the frame starting from approximately 0:02 as the camera pans, is not within the field of view at the very beginning of the video. The provided answer correctly identifies that the playground is not within sight at the initial position.",
