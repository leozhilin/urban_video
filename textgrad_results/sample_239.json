  "question": "Question: At the initial position, you are asked to navigate to the balcony on the 10th floor. When you reach the current location, what is the direction to the destination?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am currently located directly above the building, higher than 10 floors.  \nB. I am currently located above the park driveway, well above the buildings.  \nC. I am currently located near the park across from the building.  \nD. I am currently located on the side of the roof of the building, at a horizontal distance from the balcony on the 10th floor.  \nE. I am currently close to the side facade of the building, at ground floor level.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The current location is on the side of the roof of the building, and the balcony on the 10th floor is at a horizontal distance, requiring navigation downward and then horizontally to reach it.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 46)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video begins with a view from high above a city, then pans down to reveal the top of a tall, cylindrical building. From approximately 0:05 onwards, the camera descends along the side of this building. Floor numbers become visible on the facade from 0:10, indicating the camera is moving down the exterior of the building. At the end of the video (0:46), the camera is still high up, with floors 13, 14, and 15 clearly visible, looking down towards the ground. This confirms the current location is on the side of the building, significantly above the 10th floor. To reach the balcony on the 10th floor from this position, one would need to navigate downward along the building's facade and potentially horizontally to reach the specific balcony. Therefore, being \"on the side of the roof of the building\" (interpreted as high up on the building's exterior, near the top) and at a \"horizontal distance\" from the 10th-floor balcony accurately describes the current position relative to the destination. The other options are inconsistent with the visual evidence. The provided answer's reasoning aligns with this analysis.",
