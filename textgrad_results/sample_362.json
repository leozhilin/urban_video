    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"lift off and turn left facing left of the bridge and head straight.\" Given the current position on the bridge, the best next step is to turn left and go up, which aligns with the first part of the navigation instruction.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 30)]\nOption: D\nReason: The initial navigation instruction is \"lift off and turn left facing left of the bridge and head straight.\" The video starts with the agent on the bridge. To follow the instruction, the agent must first \"lift off\" (go up) and \"turn left.\" Option D, \"I turn left and go up,\" directly corresponds to the first two actions specified in the instruction. The video from 00:10 to 00:30 clearly shows the agent lifting off and turning left, confirming this is the correct next step. The provided answer is consistent with this analysis.",
