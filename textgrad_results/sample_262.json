    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The video shows a trajectory starting from a higher vantage point overlooking a residential area, moving forward and slightly downward towards a street scene with buildings on both sides. This matches option E, which describes starting from the street outside the community, flying toward the park, over the park, and reaching the current location, aligning with the observed movement and scenery changes.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 18)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video starts with a view overlooking a residential area and a park. The camera then moves forward and slightly downward towards a street with buildings on both sides. This trajectory matches option E, which describes starting from the street outside the community, flying toward the park, over the park, and reaching the current location. The initial high vantage point and the subsequent movement towards the street are consistent with this description.\n",
