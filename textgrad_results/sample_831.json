    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1)]\nOption: C\nReason: At the initial position (00:00-00:01), the camera is looking up at a very tall high-rise building. The front of this building occupies the majority and center of the field of view. From this perspective, it is impossible to discern individual floors or a specific balcony on the 16th floor. The video only reveals the 16th-floor balcony later (around 01:00) after the camera has moved and zoomed in. Therefore, the 16th-floor balcony is not within the field of view at the initial position, and the most relevant object is the front of the high-rise building in the center. The provided answer is correct.",
