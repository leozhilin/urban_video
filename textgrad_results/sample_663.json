    "feedback": "### Structured Analysis\n\n#### 1. Key Disagreements\n\n##### 1.1 Location of the House Relative to the Initial Position\n- **Reasoner's Viewpoint**: The small two-story house with a blue roof is located on the **lower right side** when considering the initial position and the direction of movement towards the current location.\n- **Critic's Viewpoint**: The small two-story house with a blue roof is located on the **lower left side** of the initial position.\n\n##### 1.2 Support by Visual Evidence\n- **Reasoner's Claim**: The reasoner's answer is not explicitly supported by specific visual evidence in the provided information.\n- **Critic's Claim**: The critic's answer references the initial position (0:00-0:04) where the camera is looking down at the community, suggesting that this timeframe provides the visual evidence for their claim.\n\n#### 2. Required Verifications\n\n##### 2.1 Specific Visual Evidence to Re-examine\n- **Initial Position (0:00-0:04)**: This timeframe needs to be re-examined to determine the exact location of the house relative to the initial position.\n- **Direction of Movement**: Understanding the direction of movement from the initial position to the current location would help validate the relative positioning described by both the reasoner and the critic.\n\n##### 2.2 Additional Frames or Perspectives\n- **Bird's Eye View**: A bird's eye view of the entire community at the initial position would provide a clear layout of all structures, including the house in question.\n- **Pathway Frames**: Frames showing the pathway from the initial position to the current location would help trace the direction of movement and confirm the relative positioning.\n\n##### 2.3 Needed Visual Information\n- **Clear Marking of the House**: Visuals that clearly mark the small two-story house with a blue roof.\n- **Reference Points**: Other identifiable structures or landmarks that can serve as reference points to determine the relative location of the house.\n\n#### 3. Resolution Path\n\n##### 3.1 Steps to Resolve Each Disagreement\n1. **Review Initial Position (0:00-0:04)**: Carefully analyze the frames from the initial position to pinpoint the exact location of the house.\n2. **Trace Direction of Movement**: Examine the sequence of frames to understand the direction of movement from the initial position to the current location.\n3. **Compare with Bird's Eye View**: If available, compare the findings with a bird's eye view of the community for confirmation.\n\n##### 3.2 Prioritize Verifications\n- **Priority 1**: Review the initial position (0:00-0:04) as it is the baseline for determining the relative location.\n- **Priority 2**: Trace the direction of movement to validate the relative positioning described by both parties.\n\n##### 3.3 Additional Evidence Needed\n- **Detailed Layout**: A detailed layout or map of the community at the initial position.\n- **Sequential Frames**: Sequential frames showing the transition from the initial position to the current location.\n\n### Summary\nThe key disagreement lies in the relative location of the house from the initial position, with the reasoner claiming it is on the lower right side and the critic claiming it is on the lower left side. To resolve this, a thorough review of the initial position frames and the direction of movement is necessary. Additional visual evidence such as a bird's eye view and sequential frames would be most helpful in verifying the exact location of the house.",
    "final_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The small two-story house with a blue roof is located on the lower left side when considering the initial position and the direction of movement towards the current location."
