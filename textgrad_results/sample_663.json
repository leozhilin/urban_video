It is located on my upper rear side.  \nC. It is located on my lower right side.  \nD. It is located on my lower left side.  \nE. It is located on my front side.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The small two-story house with a blue roof is located on the lower right side when considering the initial position and orientation of the agent. As the agent moves, this building remains consistently in the lower right quadrant relative to the starting point.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 41)]\nOption: C\nReason: At the initial position (00:00), the agent's perspective is an overhead view, with a large white building complex directly below. This is \"the building directly below your starting location.\" The \"small two-story house with a blue roof\" is visible in the upper-left portion of this large building complex in the initial frame (00:00). The question states that the agent is asked to navigate to this blue-roofed house and asks for the direction to the starting building \"when you reach your current location\" (i.e., at the blue-roofed house). Therefore, from the perspective of the blue-roofed house, the large white building complex (the starting location building) would be located on its lower right side.\n\nThe provided answer's reason states: \"The small two-story house with a blue roof is located on the lower right side when considering the initial position and orientation of the agent.\" This statement is incorrect. From the initial overhead view (00:00), the blue-roofed house is clearly located in the upper-left area relative to the large building complex that is directly below the starting point. However, despite this error in the reasoning's premise, the chosen option C is correct based on the correct interpretation of the relative positions. If the blue-roofed house is to the upper-left of the starting building, then from the blue-roofed house, the starting building is to the lower-right.",
