    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The sequence of images starts with a view from a high vantage point, likely a rooftop, given the initial frames showing building facades and windows at close range. As the sequence progresses, the perspective shifts downward to street level, ending with clear views of the sea and the street alongside it, which aligns with option A's description.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15), (1:15, 1:25)]\nOption: A\nReason: The video begins with a perspective from a high vantage point. The initial frames (0:00-0:03) show a close-up of a building facade, and as the camera pulls back and pans (0:04-0:15), it becomes clear that the view is from a rooftop, looking down upon other buildings and the distant sea. This confirms the starting point as \"on the rooftop.\" As the video progresses, the camera descends significantly, moving past buildings and trees (1:00-1:22). The final frames (1:23-1:25) show the perspective at street level, directly alongside the sea, with a clear road/path and a protective railing. This perfectly matches the description of ending \"on the street close to the sea.\" The provided answer's reasoning is accurate and aligns with the visual evidence.",
