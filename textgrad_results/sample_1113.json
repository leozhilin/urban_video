Thinking back on past Action Generations and objects you have seen, what should you approach next to get from your current location to your destination?  \nchoose:  \nA. I approach the center of the square.  \nB. I approach the edge of a building's roof.  \nC. I approach a lamppost near a street corner.  \nD. I approach a car parked on the roadside.  \nE. I approach the tree closest to the statue.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: To navigate to the stone statue to the right of the entrance, approaching the center of the square is a logical first step. This central area likely provides a clear path and better visibility of the surroundings, including the entrance and the statue. The other options involve specific objects or areas that are not as directly relevant to initially locating the statue from the current position.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 12)]\nOption: A\nReason: The video provides an overhead view of a large square in front of a prominent building. The question asks to navigate to a \"stone statue to the right of the entrance.\" Based on the video, the \"entrance\" refers to the large plaza area leading to the main building at the bottom of the square. Within this plaza, specifically around 00:03-00:05, two small, dark, rectangular objects can be identified slightly to the right of the plaza's central axis; these are the most likely \"stone statues.\"\n\nThe question asks for the *next* object to approach for high-level planning.\n*   **Option A: I approach the center of the square.** The square is the large open paved area. Moving towards its center would bring the agent into the general vicinity of the entrance plaza and the statues, providing a clear path and better visibility for the subsequent, more precise navigation to the statue. This is a logical and effective first step in high-level planning for a destination within a large open area.\n*   **Option B: I approach the edge of a building's roof.** This option is irrelevant as the agent is navigating on the ground.\n*   **Option C: I approach a lamppost near a street corner.** The street and lampposts are located to the far right of the square, away from the main building entrance and the statue. This would lead the agent away from the destination.\n*   **Option D: I approach a car parked on the roadside.** Similar to Option C, cars are parked on the roadside, which is not the direction of the destination.\n*   **Option E: I approach the tree closest to the statue.** While there are trees around the square, the statue itself is a small feature within the open plaza. Approaching a specific tree might be too granular for an initial high-level planning step, especially when the \"center of the square\" offers a more general and effective approach to the overall area containing the destination.\n\nTherefore, approaching the center of the square (Option A) is the most logical and efficient high-level first step to reach the stone statue located within the entrance plaza. The provided answer correctly identifies Option A and provides a sound reasoning that aligns with this analysis.",
