  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [takeoff from the white statue located in the park and turn left to the city show lamp post and signal and show butcher signage. fly high through the eds butcher shop signage and show pathway with signal lamp post. turn right and move towards high building and show fire exit of building and turn left to the lamp post street view.]. You move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I go up and turn right.  \nB. I descend and then fly forward.  \nC. I fly forward and then descend.  \nD. I turn left and go up.  \nE. I fly forward while rotating the camera upward.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The next step involves continuing to navigate through the urban environment. Given the current perspective and the need to align with the instruction of showing a pathway with signal lamp posts and turning right towards a high building, flying forward while rotating the camera upward will help in identifying the correct path and maintaining orientation within the cityscape. This action ensures a clear view of upcoming landmarks and pathways as described in the navigation instructions.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:00, 1:20)]\nOption: E\nReason: The agent has already completed the \"takeoff from the white statue\" and \"turn left\" parts of the instruction and has \"flown high\" (as seen from 0:42 onwards, the agent is above the buildings). The current instruction segment is \"fly high through the eds butcher shop signage and show pathway with signal lamp post. turn right and move towards high building and show fire exit of building\". From 1:00 to 1:20, the agent is flying forward at a high altitude, looking over the city. To fulfill the instruction of \"show pathway with signal lamp post\" and then \"turn right and move towards high building and show fire exit\", the agent needs to continue flying forward to progress along the path. Simultaneously rotating the camera upward would be beneficial to scan for and identify the \"high building\" and its \"fire exit\" from the current elevated perspective, which are the next key landmarks in the navigation sequence. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with this analysis.",
