    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"take off move into the bridge and move towards,\" which aligns with the current view of moving forward onto the bridge. The subsequent steps have not been initiated yet, as the agent is still approaching the bridge. Therefore, the correct action at this moment is entering the bridge and heading towards it.",
