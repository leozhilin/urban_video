    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The entrance to Building 4 is not within the field of view in the initial position. The frames show a general view of the community with buildings and greenery, but the specific entrance to Building 4 is not visible.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 10), (32, 47), (132, 148)]\nOption: C\nReason: From the initial position (0-10s), the view shows a playground and other buildings in the community, but the entrance to Building 4 is not visible. As the camera pans around (32-47s), we can see more of the community, but still not the specific entrance. At 1:32-1:48, the camera zooms in on Building 4, and we can see the entrance. However, the question asks if the entrance is visible from the *initial* position. Therefore, the entrance to Building 4 is not within the field of view at the current location.",
