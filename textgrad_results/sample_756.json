  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [go to sidewalk and turn on first walk way. turn right over tennis court. stop by nearest lake. face towards right of the subdivision. fly low and fly in open area near shed. move forward and face towards the park. take off, to fountain in center of park. make a sharp left on lake and go to nearest bridge. move forward beyond patio area.. fly over third row of trees.]. At the initial position, you are asked to navigate according to a series of movement instructions. When you reach your current location, what is your Landmark Position to the kiosk?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am on the left side of the pavilion.  \nB. I am far away from the pavilion.  \nC. I am located above the pavilion.  \nD. I am located on the right side of the pavilion.  \nE. I am in the pavilion.

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current location, as indicated by the sequence of images, shows a view from an elevated position overlooking a park area with no immediate proximity to a pavilion or kiosk. The environment suggests being far away from such structures, making option B the most plausible choice.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 51)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video shows the agent moving through a park-like environment, starting from an elevated position and continuing to fly over trees and paths. While a small building (possibly a shed or a small utility structure) is briefly visible around the 0:20 mark, the navigation instructions include \"fly over third row of trees,\" indicating significant movement and elevation. By the end of the video (e.g., 0:45-0:51), the agent is high above the ground, looking down on a vast expanse of trees and winding paths. There is no kiosk or pavilion immediately visible or in close proximity. Given the elevated and expansive view, the agent is clearly far away from any ground-level structure like a kiosk or pavilion. Therefore, \"I am far away from the pavilion\" is the most accurate description of the landmark position. The provided answer's reasoning aligns with this observation.",
