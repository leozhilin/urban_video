    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The initial frames show a view of a main road across the street in front of the agent's current location, but the entrance to the residential complex is not visible. Therefore, the most relevant object in view is the main road across the street.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 5)]\nOption: B\nReason: At the initial position (0:00-0:04), the camera is panning upwards from an aerial view. By 0:03-0:05, the main road across the street becomes clearly visible. The entrance to the residential complex with the blue moon-shaped pool (which appears around 0:12-0:14) is not yet in view at this initial stage. Therefore, the most relevant object in view at the initial position, before the complex entrance is visible, is the main road across the street. The provided answer correctly identifies this.",
