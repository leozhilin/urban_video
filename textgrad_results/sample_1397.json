Given the next move to the tree directly opposite the building entrance, what is your next move?  \nchoose:  \nA. I rise.  \nB. I descend and fly forward.  \nC. I rotate the camera upward.  \nD. I turn left and go up.  \nE. I turn right and descend.  \nF. I fly forward and to the right while descending.  \nG. I rotate the camera downward.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: To navigate to the tree directly opposite the entrance, the agent needs to descend and fly forward. The current perspective suggests that the agent is at a high altitude, so descending is necessary to approach the tree at ground level. Additionally, flying forward will help in reaching the specific location of the tree relative to the building entrance.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1)]\nOption: B\nReason: From the initial high-altitude perspective shown at 0:00, the agent is positioned high above the building and the plaza. The question asks to navigate to a tree directly opposite the building entrance, which is located on the ground level across the plaza. To reach this ground-level target from the current high altitude, the agent must first descend. Simultaneously, to move across the plaza towards the tree, the agent needs to fly forward. Therefore, \"I descend and fly forward\" is the correct and most direct next move. The provided answer correctly identifies these two essential actions.",
