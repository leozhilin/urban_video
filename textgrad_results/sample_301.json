    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"take off and turn right,\" which is the first step in the series of navigation instructions provided. The other options describe actions that come later in the sequence, but at the initial position, the correct action is to take off and turn right.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 30)]\nOption: E\nReason: The question asks what the agent is doing \"now\" at the initial position, referring to the immediate actions taken based on the provided navigation instructions. The first part of the navigation instruction is \"now take off and turn right\". The video clearly shows the agent taking off (moving upwards from approximately 0:05 to 0:15) and then turning right (from approximately 0:15 to 0:30). Therefore, option E accurately describes the actions being performed at the initial stage of the navigation. The provided answer correctly identifies this.",
