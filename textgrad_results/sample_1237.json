  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [Raise the cam slightly and turn left to face the tall building, then right to face the beige building. Move straight toward the tall building, fly over its roof, and tilt the cam right while flying. Lower the cam to face the path and building, pause, then go straight. Near the tree, raise the cam slightly, turn right to face the distant tall building, and go straight. Turn left to face another building, move straight toward the tree, then turn left toward the tall beige building. Fly over its roof, go straight, and near the building, tilt the cam right to face the small building. Turn left to face the beige building, tilt down briefly, then up. Lower the cam to face the road below the hoardings, and continue straight.]. At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. What are you doing now?  \nchoose:  \nA. I walk straight toward the building.  \nB. I make the cam levitate and face the high-rise building.  \nC. I turn the cam to the left, face the building, and move directly toward the tree.  \nD. I float the cam below the enclosure.  \nE. I turn the cam to the right to face the tall building in the distance.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The current view shows a distant tall building, indicating that the camera has been turned right to face it, as per the instruction \"Near the tree, raise the cam slightly, turn right to face the distant tall building, and go straight.\" This aligns with option E.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(2:15, 3:02)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instruction states: \"Near the tree, raise the cam slightly, turn right to face the distant tall building, and go straight.\" In the video, around 2:15, a tree is visible in the foreground. From approximately 2:15 to 2:25, the camera raises slightly and turns to the right. By 2:25, the camera is clearly facing a distant cityscape with tall buildings across a body of water. This view is maintained as the camera continues to move straight until the end of the video at 3:02. Therefore, the current state of the camera, particularly its orientation, is a direct result of having turned right to face the distant tall building, which aligns perfectly with option E. The provided answer correctly identifies this action and its visual evidence.",
