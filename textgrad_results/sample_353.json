  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [rise from the concrete and turn right. fly over the middle of the street until you reach the buildings on the left with the short concrete wall like structure around them. turn left right beside the buildings and fly along beside them. when you get to the middle darker brown building then angle straight up and fly toward the top of the building. before you get to the top turn right and begin to level off. fly toward the building with the half pipe or half circle design on the edge of the roof. when you get to the half circle then turn left and downward and fly toward the red roof of the smaller building beside the one you climbed. stop well before you get to the roof.]. At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. What are you doing now?  \nchoose:  \nA. I fly across the middle of the street until I reach the building on the left, surrounded by a short concrete wall-like structure.  \nB. I turn left next to the building and fly along the side of the building.  \nC. I go around the top of the building from the right and continue flying forward.  \nD. I lift out of the concrete and turn right.  \nE. I turn right and start leveling off.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"rise from the concrete and turn right,\" which matches the action described in option D. The subsequent frames show a progression that aligns with the rest of the given instructions, starting from this initial movement.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 12)]\nOption: D\nReason: The navigation instruction given at the initial position starts with \"rise from the concrete and turn right.\" The video frames from 0:00 to approximately 0:12 clearly show the camera (representing the agent's perspective) lifting upwards from the ground level (\"concrete\") and simultaneously turning to the right. This directly matches the action described in option D, \"I lift out of the concrete and turn right.\" The provided answer is correct.",
