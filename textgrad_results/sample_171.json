You move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of your next steps, what is the best next step?  \nchoose:  \nA. I rise and then turn right to fly forward.  \nB. I drop down and turn left.  \nC. I fly forward while rising.  \nD. I turn right and fly forward.  \nE. I rotate the camera downward and then lower it.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The current view suggests that the agent is at a high vantage point, likely needing to continue navigating over buildings. Given the instruction to \"fly forward while rising,\" this option aligns with maintaining altitude and progressing towards the next landmark in the navigation instructions.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 156)]\nOption: C\nReason: The navigation instruction given at the initial position includes multiple instances of \"move forward and go over the buildings\". The video shows the agent taking off (0:00-0:08) and then continuously flying forward at a high altitude over a cityscape (0:19-1:56). At the end of the video, the agent is still high above the buildings, moving forward. To continue fulfilling the instruction to \"go over the buildings\", the agent must maintain its forward trajectory and ensure it clears any obstacles. \"Flying forward while rising\" (Option C) is the most suitable action as it combines the necessary forward movement with an upward adjustment or maintenance of altitude required to clear buildings. Options B and E, which involve dropping down, are incorrect as the instruction to \"get down\" appears much later in the sequence. Options A and D, which involve turning right, are premature as the specific landmarks for turns (e.g., \"dates car wash board\") have not yet been reached or are not visible in the current view. The provided answer's reasoning aligns with this interpretation, correctly identifying the need to continue navigating over buildings and maintaining altitude.",
