  "question_category": "Duration",
  "ground_truth": "B",
  "textgrad_result": {
    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The sequence of images shows that the agent continues to fly along the river bank for a longer duration compared to the time spent flying under the trees. The frames depict a more extended path alongside the river, indicating a longer travel time in that area.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15), (15, 35)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video first shows the agent moving towards and then under the trees (0-15s). After that, the video shows the agent flying along the river bank (15-35s). Visually, the river bank scene lasts longer than the tree scene. Therefore, flying along the river bank takes longer. The provided answer is correct.\n",
