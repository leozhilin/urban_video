  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [take off straight up into the air. halfway across the lake, turn slightly to the left and fly over the road. just before the ord intersection, turn slightly towards the last building on the right in that block. at the optician billboard, turn to the left in the direction of 10 oclock and fly forward. fly over 2 blocks of buildings then go lower to the ground in between the and and ord blocks of buildings. land on the far side of the sidewalk. turn to the left in the direction of 9 oclock. fly forward. at the first intersection, stop and look down at the ground. look up at the sky and turn to the right in the direction of 3 oclock. fly over the trees and decrease altitude until reaching the bridge. at the trees, turn to the left in the direction of 7 oclock. fly over the trees and decrease altitude at the fountain. turn to the right in the direction of 3 oclock and fly over the trees and water.]. At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. When you reach your current location, what is your Landmark Position to the bridge?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am on the right side of the bridge.  \nB. I am far away from the bridge.  \nC. I am located above the bridge.  \nD. I am located on the left side of the bridge.  \nE. I am under the bridge.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current location, as depicted in the images, shows a view of the city with buildings and a body of water but no bridge is visible. The instructions indicate that the agent has not yet reached the bridge, suggesting that it is still far away from the current position.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(2, 22), (2, 59), (2, 59), (3, 29)]\nOption: B\nReason: The navigation instruction states, \"fly over the trees and decrease altitude until reaching the bridge.\" This clearly indicates that the bridge is a future landmark that the agent is moving towards, implying the agent has not yet reached it. The video frames from approximately 2:59 onwards show the agent flying over a body of water with a city skyline in the distance, and a bridge structure is visible on the far left side of the water, confirming it is still at a distance. Therefore, the agent is far away from the bridge. The provided answer's reason incorrectly states \"no bridge is visible,\" as a bridge is indeed visible in the distance, but its conclusion that the agent is \"far away from the bridge\" is correct.",

The instructions indicate that the agent has not yet reached the bridge, suggesting that it is still far away from the current position."
