    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The navigation instruction indicates that after moving forward towards the green trees and getting closer to the red tree, the next step is to turn right and fly over the river. Since the current view shows a proximity to the trees and no immediate indication of being over the river, the logical next step would be to prepare for this maneuver by dropping down and turning right, aligning with option B.",
