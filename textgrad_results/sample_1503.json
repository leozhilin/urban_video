    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The images show an off-white high-rise building on the right front with greenery near it on the ground directly in front. Behind the current position, there is a road, and below, there is a sidewalk along the roadside, which matches the description in option A.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 17)]\nOption: A\nReason: The video frames, which provide an aerial view of the environment, clearly show several off-white high-rise buildings. There are extensive green areas (grass and trees) surrounding these buildings and along the pathways, which can be interpreted as \"greenery near the high-rise building on the ground directly in front\" from a ground-level perspective. A prominent road runs parallel to the buildings, and sidewalks are visible alongside this road. If the agent is positioned on the sidewalk facing the buildings, then the road would be behind them, and the sidewalk would be below them. The description in Option A accurately reflects the key features and their general spatial relationships as depicted in the provided aerial map. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with this observation.",
