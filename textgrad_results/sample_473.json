    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The topmost purple ledge is not in view, but the top of a high-rise building is prominently visible in the center of the field of view. This aligns with option E, which correctly identifies the most relevant object in the current perspective.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1)]\nOption: E\nReason: At the initial position (00:00-00:01), the video displays a panoramic view of a city model. There are no purple objects, including \"purple ledges\" or \"purple window sills,\" visible anywhere in the scene. Therefore, the condition \"if the topmost purple ledge is not in view\" is met. In this initial view, a very tall, slender high-rise building is prominently visible in the distant skyline, slightly to the right of the absolute center of the frame. Its top is a distinct feature against the sky. This aligns with option E, which states that \"the top of a high-rise building is in the center of my field of view,\" serving as the most relevant and identifiable landmark in the initial perspective. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with this observation.",
