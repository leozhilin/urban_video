  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [go to sidewalk and turn on first walk way. turn right over tennis court. stop by nearest lake. face towards right of the subdivision. fly low and fly in open area near shed. move forward and face towards the park. take off, to fountain in center of park. make a sharp left on lake and go to nearest bridge. move forward beyond patio area.. fly over third row of trees.]. At the initial position, you are asked to navigate according to a series of movement instructions. When you reach the current location, what is your landmark position from the lake?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am on the left side of the lake.  \nB. I am far away from the lake.  \nC. I am above the lake.  \nD. I am on the right side of the lake.  \nE. I am on the ground near the lake.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current location, as depicted in the frames, shows a view of a dense forested area with no immediate proximity to a lake. The environment suggests that the agent has moved away from the lake after completing earlier instructions related to it, indicating that the agent is now far away from the lake.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:40, 3:29)]\nOption: B\nReason: The navigation instructions lead the agent to \"make a sharp left on lake and go to nearest bridge\" (0:50-1:00), placing the agent alongside the lake. However, the final instruction is \"fly over third row of trees\" (1:20-3:29). From approximately 1:40 onwards, the video shows the agent flying at a higher altitude over a vast expanse of trees. While the lake is still visible in the distance on the left side of the frame, it appears increasingly smaller and further away as the agent moves deeper into the forested area. This indicates that the agent has moved a significant distance away from the immediate vicinity of the lake. Therefore, the agent is far away from the lake at the current location. The provided answer correctly identifies that the agent is far away from the lake, as the visual evidence shows a dense forested area with no immediate proximity to the lake, suggesting the agent has moved away from it.",
