    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The instruction states to \"Fly above them,\" indicating that the current position is directly above the two yellow bicycles. Therefore, the correct positional relationship is that you are located above the two yellow bicycles.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 59)]\nOption: D\nReason: The question asks for the positional relationship between the agent and the two yellow bicycles \"when it reached current position\". The series of movement instructions provided includes \"Fly above them.\" This final instruction explicitly defines the positional relationship at the \"current position\" as being above the bicycles. Therefore, based on the given instructions, the agent is located above the two yellow bicycles. The video provides the visual context of the environment, but the specific positional relationship is directly derived from the textual instruction. The provided answer correctly identifies this.",
