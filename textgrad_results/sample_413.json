  "textgrad_result": {
    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The instruction states to \"Fly above them,\" indicating that the current position is directly above the two yellow bicycles. Therefore, the correct positional relationship is that you are located above the two yellow bicycles.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 60)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video shows an aerial view of the environment. The question asks about the positional relationship after following the instructions \"Move in the direction of the river. Find two yellow bicycles at the end of the road. Fly above them.\" The final instruction \"Fly above them\" indicates that the agent is currently positioned above the two yellow bicycles. Therefore, the correct answer is D. I am located above the two yellow bicycles. The video shows the agent moving along the river and then flying above the road. While the yellow bicycles are not explicitly visible in the video, the instruction implies that they are present at the end of the road. The provided answer is correct.\n",

    "final_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The instruction states to \"Fly above them,\" indicating that the current position is directly above the two yellow bicycles. Therefore, the correct positional relationship is that you are located above the two yellow bicycles."
