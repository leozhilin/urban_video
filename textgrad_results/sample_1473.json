    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The sequence of images shows an aerial view of the environment, indicating that the agent is flying over buildings. This matches the initial instruction to \"take off,\" suggesting that the current action is flying over buildings.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 155)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video begins with the agent at ground level (0:00-0:05), then shows the agent ascending (0:05-0:15), which corresponds to the \"take off\" instruction. From approximately 0:15 onwards, the camera perspective is clearly aerial, showing the agent moving forward over a cityscape with numerous buildings below. This directly indicates that the agent is \"flying over buildings,\" which is the current action being performed after taking off. The provided answer correctly identifies this action and links it to the initial instruction.",
