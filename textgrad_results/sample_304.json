    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1)]\nOption: D\nReason: At the initial position (00:00), the camera is looking across the cityscape. While a tall building is visible on the right, the specific 26th floor balcony is not within the field of view. The camera subsequently pans downwards (starting around 00:06) to reveal the lower floors of the building, including the clearly marked 26th floor at 00:09. Therefore, at the initial position, the destination is not visible. The provided answer is correct.",
