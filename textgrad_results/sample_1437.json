When you reach the current location, what is the direction between you and the destination?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am currently on the roof of the building, with the playground directly below and slightly to the right.  \nB. I am currently above the basketball court, with the playground on the right.  \nC.

    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:00, 0:09), (0:53, 1:41)]\nOption: B\nReason: At the initial position (0:00-0:09), the drone is on a building roof, and the destination playground (with blue structures and tires) is clearly visible to the left of the building (around 0:03). The \"current location\" is where the video ends, with the drone hovering directly above the basketball court (1:30-1:41). From this current location (above the basketball court), the building where the drone started is visible to the right of the basketball court (from 0:53 onwards). Since the destination playground is located next to that building, it is generally to the right of the current location (above the basketball court). The provided answer correctly identifies the option but its reason is partially inaccurate; while the playground's general direction is to the right, it is not directly \"visible to the right side of the frame\" from the basketball court's perspective, as it is obscured by the building.",
