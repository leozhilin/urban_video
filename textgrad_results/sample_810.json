Across this street, a large residential complex with numerous tall buildings becomes visible. From approximately 0:12 to 0:15, a distinct moon-shaped blue pool of water is clearly seen within the central courtyard area of this residential complex, which is identified as the destination. The agent's perspective is clearly from above the street, looking directly across at the entrance area of the residential complex where the pool is located. Therefore, the agent is currently above the street, opposite the entrance to the residential area. The provided answer is consistent with this observation.",
