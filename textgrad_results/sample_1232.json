    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: As the agent descends towards the green belt and the ground paved with stone tiles, the perspective shifts closer to the fountain, indicating a decrease in distance between the agent and the fountain.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:08, 0:40)]\nOption: C\nReason: As the video progresses from an elevated view (around 0:08) and the camera descends towards the green belt and the ground paved with stone tiles, the fountain, which is initially seen from a distance, gradually appears larger and more prominent in the frame. This change in perspective clearly indicates that the distance between the agent (camera) and the fountain is decreasing during the descent. The camera moves from a high aerial view to a ground-level view, getting closer to the fountain area. The provided answer correctly identifies this decrease in distance and the reason for it.",
