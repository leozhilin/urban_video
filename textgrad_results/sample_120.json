  "question": "Question: You are navigating to the center of the tarmac. What is the correct summary of your trajectory from the start to the current position?  \nChoice:  \nA. I start from a high-rise building, descend to street level, and then move toward the helipad.  \nB. I start from the street, rise vertically to the roof, and then move horizontally to the helipad.  \nC. I take off from above a high-rise building and descend vertically to a position slightly off-center on the helipad.  \nD. I start from a distance, fly directly to the roof of the building, and land on the helicopter pad.  \nE. I start from the ground, move horizontally to the building, rise to the roof, and reach the current position above the helipad.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The sequence of images shows a clear transition from a distant view of the city to a direct overhead view of the helipad, indicating that the agent started from a distance, flew directly to the roof of the building, and landed on the helicopter pad.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 35)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video begins with a wide, high-altitude view of a city, showing the agent starting \"from a distance\" (0:00). The camera then rapidly descends and zooms in, maintaining a direct trajectory towards the helipad located on the roof of a high-rise building (0:01-0:20). A small drone, representing the agent, becomes visible and continues its descent, making a slight horizontal adjustment to land precisely on the center of the helipad (0:20-0:35). This sequence clearly depicts a trajectory where the agent starts from a distance, flies directly to the roof of the building, and lands on the helicopter pad.\n\nThe provided answer correctly identifies Option D and provides a reason that aligns with the visual evidence in the video. The transition from a distant city view to a direct overhead view of the helipad, followed by the landing, accurately supports the description in Option D.",
