    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The initial position does not show a gray-signed store on the curb of the building to the right. The stores visible are with different colored signs, and none of them appear to be gray-signed. Therefore, the destination is not within sight at the current location.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 17), (109, 138)]\nOption: [C]\nReason: From the initial position (0-17s), the view shows buildings and streets, but no gray-signed store is visible on the curb of the building to the right. As the video progresses (109-138s), the camera zooms in and reveals a row of stores. Among them, there is a store with a gray sign, \"\u5353\u9ad8\u7f8e\u7f1d\". However, this store is not visible from the initial position. Therefore, the destination is not within sight at the current location.",
