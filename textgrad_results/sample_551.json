You move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I turn left and go up.  \nB. I fly forward and then descend.  \nC. I turn right and fly forward.  \nD. I lower and rotate the camera downward.  \nE. I rise, turn right, and fly forward.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The navigation instruction suggests moving to the top of a building and then crossing near the lake. Given the current perspective from a high vantage point, rising, turning right, and flying forward aligns with exploring further towards the lake and completing the next steps of the instructions effectively.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(2:40, 3:43)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instruction states, \"...move to top of the building. top of the building and nearby the lake and cross the right side of the building.\" The video shows the agent reaching a high vantage point (from approximately 2:40 onwards, clearly visible at 3:43), which fulfills the \"top of the building and nearby the lake\" part of the instruction (the lake is visible to the left). Therefore, the immediate next step is to \"cross the right side of the building.\" From the current high aerial perspective, the city's buildings extend to the right. To effectively \"cross\" this area, which may involve navigating over or around various structures of different heights, rising slightly (to gain more clearance and a better overview), turning right (to orient towards the designated side), and then flying forward (to execute the crossing) is the most logical and comprehensive next step. The provided answer's reason is incorrect because it states \"aligns with exploring further towards the lake,\" which contradicts the instruction to \"cross the right side of the building\" and the visual evidence that turning right would move away from the lake.",
