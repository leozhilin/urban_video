    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: To navigate to the purple ledge on the top floor, the first step is to rise in elevation since the target is on a higher level. Rising will provide a better vantage point to locate and approach the specific ledge.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 10)]\nOption: A\nReason: At the initial position (0:00), the agent is at a low elevation, and the purple ledge on the top floor is not visible. To navigate to a target on a \"top floor,\" the most immediate and necessary next step is to rise in elevation. This action allows the agent to gain altitude, which is essential for reaching a higher-level target and also provides a better vantage point to locate and approach the specific purple ledge, which becomes visible only after the agent has risen significantly (around 0:10). The provided answer correctly identifies \"I rise\" as the appropriate first step, as the target is on a higher level.",
