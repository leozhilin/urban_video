  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [take off move into the bridge and move towards. now move little forward and turn left back your view and move forward to the road. now turn right and fly over the building and closely to the coca cola from above to the buildings and turn right to the river and stay there.]. At the initial position, you are asked to navigate according to a series of movement instructions. When you reach the current location, what is your Landmark Position to the tallest building?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am located to the left of the tallest building.  \nB. I am farther away from the tallest building.  \nC. I am located above the tallest building.  \nD. I am located to the right of the tallest building.  \nE. I am located below the tallest building.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current location, as depicted in the final frames, shows the agent on a road surrounded by buildings. The tallest building is visible but not immediately adjacent, indicating that the agent is farther away from it rather than being to its left, right, above, or below it.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(2:40, 3:15)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video shows the agent starting on a bridge, moving across it, then going under the bridge, and finally emerging on the riverbank. At the current location (from approximately 2:40 to the end of the video), the agent is positioned on a road next to a river, looking across the water at a city skyline. Among the buildings in the skyline, there is a clearly identifiable tallest building (visible prominently from 2:40 onwards, particularly the one on the right side of the bridge from the agent's perspective). Since the agent is on one side of a wide river and the tallest building is on the opposite side, the agent is clearly \"farther away\" from it. The building is not immediately to the left or right, nor is the agent above or below it in a direct vertical sense. Therefore, \"farther away\" is the most accurate description of the landmark position. The provided answer correctly identifies this.",
