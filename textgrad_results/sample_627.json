    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The navigation instruction indicates that after flying toward the large building with a satellite dish and making a left turn, the next step is to descend and land on the ground next to trees. The current position appears to be in the air near buildings, so the logical next step is to fly forward and then begin the descent to land as instructed.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 56)]\nOption: [B]\nReason: From the video, we can see the large building with a satellite dish on top. According to the navigation instruction, after flying toward the large building with a satellite dish on top and making a left turn, the next step is to descend and land on the ground next to trees. So the logical next step is to fly forward and then begin the descent to land as instructed.",
