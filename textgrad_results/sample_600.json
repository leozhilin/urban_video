    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The sequence of images shows the agent moving from a bridge into an urban area, then flying over buildings. The final frames indicate that the agent is above the city with a clear view of the river below, suggesting that the current location is above the river.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(3:15, 3:53)]\nOption: C\nReason: The navigation instructions state to \"fly over the building\" and then \"turn right to the river and stay there.\" From approximately 3:15 onwards, the agent begins to ascend and fly over the city buildings. In the final frames of the video (from 3:50 to 3:53), the agent is positioned high above the city, looking down. The river is clearly visible directly below and to the right of the agent's perspective, indicating that the agent is located above the river. Therefore, option C is the correct description of the river's landmark position relative to the agent's current location.",
