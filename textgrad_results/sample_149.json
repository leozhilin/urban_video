  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [once you have risen turn right until you are facing a rectangular tower with an projection on its roof. land in front of a door and mailbox which is street level to this building. fly straight until you are close to this tower. then turn left until you see a passageway between two towers. fly straight. then lower your altitude so that you can see the top of a building then fly straight. turn left until you see a pond ringed with green and red leafed trees. head towards the pond. fly over the pond. once you have flown over the pond go through the trees surrounding the pond. when you see a small building with a billboard on it, fly towards it then lower your height.]. You move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I fly forward and then descend.  \nB. I turn right and go up.  \nC. I turn left and fly forward.  \nD. I descend and turn left.  \nE. I rotate the camera downward.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The navigation instruction indicates that after flying straight and being close to the tower, the next step is to turn left until a passageway between two towers is visible. The current view shows a straight path towards a tower, suggesting that the agent is in the process of approaching it. Therefore, the logical next step would be to prepare for the left turn by aligning the direction towards the passageway as instructed. Thus, turning left and flying forward aligns with the given instructions.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:00, 1:19)]\nOption: C\nReason: The navigation instruction states, \"fly straight until you are close to this tower. then turn left until you see a passageway between two towers.\" From approximately 1:00 to 1:19, the agent is flying straight towards the rectangular tower and is getting progressively closer. By the end of the video, the agent is very close to the tower, indicating that the condition \"until you are close to this tower\" has been met or is about to be met. Therefore, the immediate next step according to the instructions is to \"turn left until you see a passageway between two towers.\" Option C, \"I turn left and fly forward,\" accurately reflects this next required action, as turning left is the primary directional change, and flying forward would be necessary to navigate towards and through the passageway.\n\nThe provided answer is correct and aligns with my analysis.",
