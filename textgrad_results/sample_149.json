  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [once you have risen turn right until you are facing a rectangular tower with an projection on its roof. land in front of a door and mailbox which is street level to this building. fly straight until you are close to this tower. then turn left until you see a passageway between two towers. fly straight. then lower your altitude so that you can see the top of a building then fly straight. turn left until you see a pond ringed with green and red leafed trees. head towards the pond. fly over the pond. once you have flown over the pond go through the trees surrounding the pond. when you see a small building with a billboard on it, fly towards it then lower your height.]. You move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I fly forward and then descend.  \nB. I turn right and go up.  \nC. I turn left and fly forward.  \nD. I descend and turn left.  \nE. I rotate the camera downward.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The navigation instruction indicates that after flying straight and being close to the tower, the next step is to turn left until a passageway between two towers is visible. The current view shows a straight path towards a tower, suggesting that the next logical action is to prepare for the left turn as instructed. Therefore, turning left and flying forward aligns with the given instructions.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(00:56, 01:19)]\nOption: C\nReason: The navigation instruction states: \"fly straight until you are close to this tower. then turn left until you see a passageway between two towers. fly straight.\" In the video segment from 00:56 to 01:19, the agent is flying straight along the street, getting progressively closer to the rectangular tower on the right. This indicates that the agent is currently executing or about to complete the instruction \"fly straight until you are close to this tower.\" Following this, the very next instruction is to \"turn left\" and then \"fly straight\" again. Therefore, \"I turn left and fly forward\" is the most accurate and logical next step, aligning perfectly with the given navigation instructions. The provided answer is correct.",
