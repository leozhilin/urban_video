Tilt slightly to the right to align more directly with the park and intersection.  \n          B. Descend toward the street near the park.  \n          C. Turn left and return to the wide street lined with tall buildings.  \n          D. Hover in place to capture a better view of the skyline.  \n          E. Return to the starting position.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: After reaching the roof of a nearby building, the next logical step is to descend toward the street near the park. This aligns with the agent's trajectory and perspective shown in the images, where the agent appears to be moving towards the ground level after observing the skyline from an elevated position.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 14), (30, 127)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video begins at street level (0:00-0:14), then the agent ascends, gaining altitude (0:15-0:30). By approximately 0:30-0:40, the agent has reached an elevated position, offering a panoramic view of the city skyline, a large park, and a lake. This corresponds to \"reaching the roof of a nearby building.\" From around 0:50 onwards, the agent's perspective clearly begins to descend and move forward, getting closer to the street level adjacent to the park. The camera angle shifts from a high vantage point looking down to a lower one, indicating a descent towards the street near the park. Therefore, \"Descend toward the street near the park\" is the next step. The provided answer is correct and aligns with the visual evidence.",
