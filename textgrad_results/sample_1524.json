    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The current view shows a high building and the mobile tower, which aligns with the instruction to \"show the high building mobile tower and show american signage.\" The next step in the instructions is to \"move towards to the sea view,\" suggesting that flying forward and rising would be the best action to achieve this, as it will provide a broader view of the surroundings and help locate the sea view.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(04:25, 06:25)]\nOption: A\nReason: The current position of the agent, as seen from approximately 04:25 onwards, is high above the city, with the high building mobile tower visible (completing \"turn left and the high building mobile tower\"). The next instruction in the sequence is \"move towards to the sea view.\" To effectively move towards and \"show the sea view\" (and subsequently \"show the building mobile tower\" and \"end up with building wall\"), the most logical and efficient action is to fly forward in the direction of the sea. Rising further, or maintaining a high altitude, would ensure a clear and expansive view of the sea and the cityscape, which is crucial for fulfilling the subsequent instructions. Descending or turning away would hinder the objective. Therefore, \"I fly forward and then rise\" is the best next step. The video from 04:25 to 06:25 demonstrates the agent moving forward and maintaining a high vantage point, with the sea becoming more prominent in the view. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with the video evidence and the navigation instructions.",
