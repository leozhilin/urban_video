    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The initial position shows a view of tall buildings and roads, but there is no visible elevator or entrance in the field of view. The scene primarily consists of external structures and does not provide a clear indication of an elevator's location.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 0)]\nOption: E\nReason: At the initial position (0:00), the video displays a wide, high-angle view of a city with multiple tall buildings and a road. From this vantage point, there is no visible entrance to a building or an elevator structure. The scene is too distant and general to identify such specific architectural features. Therefore, the destination is not within sight at the current location. The provided answer is correct.",
