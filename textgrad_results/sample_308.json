    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The initial frames show a view from above, and there is a small pavilion with a red roof visible in the lower part of the field of view. The blue-roofed building is not in sight, making the red-roofed pavilion the most relevant object in the current field of view.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 5)]\nOption: B\nReason: At the initial position (0:00-0:05), the camera is directly above a building with a red tiled roof. This structure is clearly a small pavilion or building. No blue-roofed building is visible in these initial frames. As the camera slightly pulls back and pans up within the first few seconds, this red-roofed pavilion becomes visible in the lower part of the field of view, making it the most prominent and relevant object in the immediate surroundings. The provided answer correctly identifies this object and its location relative to the expanding initial field of view, and accurately states that a blue-roofed building is not in sight.",
