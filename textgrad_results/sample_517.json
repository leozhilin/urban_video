    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:17, 1:29)]\nOption: B\nReason: The navigation instruction states to \"fly towards the highway, then turn left and land on the roof of the building on the left.\" The video shows the drone flying towards the highway (around 0:50-1:00). From 1:00 to 1:10, the drone pans left, indicating it is now looking along the highway to its left. From 1:17 onwards, the drone descends towards a building, which is the \"building on the left\" as per the instruction. When the drone is at this \"current location\" (the roof of the building), as seen in the frames from 1:17 to 1:29, the main road/highway is clearly visible to the right of the building. Therefore, the road is on the right side of the agent at its current location. The provided answer is correct.",
