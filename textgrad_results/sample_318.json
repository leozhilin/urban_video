    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The provided frames show an aerial view of a cityscape with roads, buildings, and parked cars. There is no visible indication of a seller's store or a bus stop in the immediate field of view. The perspective is too high and broad to identify specific smaller features like a store behind a bus stop. Therefore, the destination is not within sight at the current location.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1), (26, 30), (36, 41), (1:17, 1:20)]\nOption: D\nReason: From the initial position (0-1s), the view is too zoomed in on the building to see the surrounding environment. From (26-30s), (36-41s), and (1:17-1:20), the view is too high to identify a specific store behind a bus stop. Therefore, the destination is not within sight at the current location.",
