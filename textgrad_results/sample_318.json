    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The provided frames show an aerial view of a cityscape with roads, buildings, and parked cars. There is no visible indication of a seller's store or a bus stop in the immediate field of view. The perspective is too high and broad to discern specific details like a store behind a bus stop. Therefore, the destination is not within sight at the current location.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 6)]\nOption: D\nReason: At the initial position (0:00-0:06), the video presents a high aerial view, initially focusing on a building and then panning out to show a wide cityscape. From this elevated and broad perspective, it is impossible to discern specific details such as a \"seller's store\" or a \"nearby bus stop.\" The objects at street level are too small and indistinct to identify the requested destination. Therefore, the destination is not within sight at the current (initial) location. The provided answer's reasoning is accurate and aligns with the visual evidence from the initial frames of the video.",
