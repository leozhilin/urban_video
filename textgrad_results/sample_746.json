    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"go to sidewalk and turn on first walk way,\" which is the first step in the series of movement instructions. The current view shows a pathway that aligns with this initial step, indicating that the agent is at the starting point and about to follow the first instruction.",
    "evaluation": "Okay, I will analyze the video and provide my answer in the specified format.\n\nLocation: [(0, 5)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video starts with a view of a wooden structure, then pans to show a pathway surrounded by trees. This aligns with the initial instruction to \"go to sidewalk and turn on first walk way,\" suggesting the agent is at the beginning of the path and about to start following the instructions. The view does not show any evidence of flying, facing a subdivision, turning on a lake, or taking off towards a fountain. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer.\n",
