    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The surrounding environment includes many high-rise buildings visible in the distance, a highway on the right side of the view, and a park area below, which matches the description in option A.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 109)]\nOption: A\nReason: The video shows a descent from a high-rise building. From the initial high vantage point (0:00-0:05), many high-rise buildings are visible in the distance, a highway is clearly seen on the right side, and a large green area resembling a park is visible below the building. As the camera descends to the 10th floor (around 0:55 onwards), these features remain consistent. The surrounding environment still includes numerous high-rise buildings in the cityscape, the highway is distinctly on the right side of the building, and while the immediate area directly below the 10th floor balcony includes a paved area (parking lot/driveway), there are also significant landscaped green spaces and trees at the base of the building and adjacent to the roads, which collectively can be described as a \"park area below.\" Therefore, option A accurately describes the surrounding environment.",
