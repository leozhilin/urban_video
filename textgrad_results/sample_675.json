  "question": "Question: At the initial position, you are asked to navigate to the stone statue to the left of the entrance. At your current location, if the stone statue to the left of the entrance is not within your field of view, what is the most relevant object in your field of view, and where is this object?  \nchoose:  \nA. I see the stone statue on the left side of the entrance.  \nB. I cannot see the stone statue on the left side of the entrance, but there is a crossroads on the right side of my field of vision.  \nC. I cannot see the stone statue on the left side of the entrance, but I see the main entrance of a building in the lower part of my field of vision.  \nD. I cannot see the stone statue on the left side of the entrance, but I see a group of high-rise buildings in the upper part of my field of vision.  \nE. I cannot see the stone statue on the left side of the entrance, but I see a stone lion statue on the left side of the main entrance in the lower part of my field of vision.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The stone statue to the left of the entrance is not within the field of view, but a stone lion statue is visible on the left side of the main entrance in the lower part of the field of vision. This matches the description in option E.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 5)]\nOption: D\nReason: At the initial position (0-5s), the stone statue on the left side of the entrance is not within the field of view. Instead, a group of high-rise buildings is visible in the upper part of the field of vision. Therefore, the most relevant object in the field of view is a group of high-rise buildings in the upper part of the field of vision.",
    "feedback": "### Structured Analysis\n\n#### 1. Key Disagreements\n\n##### 1.1 Most Relevant Object in Field of View\n- **Original Answer Viewpoint**: The most relevant object is a stone lion statue on the left side of the main entrance in the lower part of the field of vision (Option E).\n- **Evaluation Viewpoint**: The most relevant object is a group of high-rise buildings in the upper part of the field of vision (Option D).\n\n**Visual Evidence Support**:\n- The original answer claims the presence of a stone lion statue, but this is not supported by explicit visual evidence mentioned in the evaluation.\n- The evaluation mentions high-rise buildings in the upper part of the field of vision, which also lacks direct visual confirmation in the provided context.\n\n##### 1.2 Position of the Most Relevant Object\n- **Original Answer Viewpoint**: The stone lion statue is located on the left side of the main entrance in the lower part of the field of vision.\n- **Evaluation Viewpoint**: The high-rise buildings are located in the upper part of the field of vision.\n\n**Visual Evidence Support**:\n- The specific positioning (lower part vs. upper part) is a key point of disagreement and requires visual confirmation to determine accuracy.\n\n#### 2. Required Verifications\n\n##### 2.1 Re-examination of Visual Evidence\n- **Stone Lion Statue**: Verify if there is indeed a stone lion statue on the left side of the main entrance in the lower part of the field of vision.\n- **High-rise Buildings**: Confirm the presence and location (upper part of the field of vision) of high-rise buildings.\n\n##### 2.2 Additional Frames or Perspectives\n- **Initial Position Frame**: Obtain a clear frame from the initial position (0-5s) to analyze the field of view comprehensively.\n- **Panoramic View**: A panoramic view at the initial position could help identify all objects within the field of vision.\n\n##### 2.3 Specific Visual Information Needed\n- **Detailed Description of Objects**: Clear identification and description of all objects visible in the initial position.\n- **Object Location Confirmation**: Precise location details (e.g., left side, lower part, upper part) of each identified object.\n\n#### 3. Resolution Path\n\n##### 3.1 Steps to Resolve Each Disagreement\n1. **Review Initial Position Frame**: Carefully examine the frame from the initial position to identify all visible objects.\n2. **Identify and Locate Objects**: Specifically look for the stone lion statue and high-rise buildings as mentioned in the viewpoints.\n3. **Compare with Descriptions**: Match the observed objects with the descriptions provided in the options to determine the most accurate one.\n\n##### 3.2 Prioritize Verifications\n- **Primary Verification**: Confirm the presence and location of the stone lion statue and high-rise buildings.\n- **Secondary Verification**: Analyze other objects mentioned in the remaining options to ensure no other more relevant objects are overlooked.\n\n##### 3.3 Additional Evidence Needed\n- **Clear Initial Frame**: A high-resolution image or video frame from the initial position.\n- **Object Labels**: Labels or annotations on the frame to clearly mark and describe each object.\n- **Contextual Information**: Any additional contextual information about the environment that might aid in identification.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe key disagreements center around the identification and location of the most relevant object in the field of view at the initial position. To resolve these, a thorough re-examination of the visual evidence, particularly the initial position frame, is necessary. Obtaining a clear and detailed view, along with specific object descriptions and locations, will help verify the accurate option. Prioritizing the verification of the stone lion statue and high-rise buildings is crucial, with additional frames and labels providing further clarity.",
    "final_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The stone statue to the left of the entrance is not within the field of view, but a stone lion statue is visible on the left side of the main entrance in the lower part of the field of vision. This matches the description in option E."
