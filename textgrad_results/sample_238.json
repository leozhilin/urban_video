    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The current location shows a view directly above a road with trees and a sidewalk, indicating that the agent is across the street from the bus stop. The presence of the road and the layout suggest that the bus stop is on the opposite side of the street.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:15, 1:59)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video, particularly from 1:15 onwards, shows an aerial view where the agent (drone) is positioned directly above a multi-lane road. A bus stop shelter is clearly visible on the sidewalk on the left side of the road (from the drone's perspective looking down). This indicates that the agent is currently above the road and the bus stop is located across the street. The provided answer's reasoning is accurate and consistent with the visual evidence.",
