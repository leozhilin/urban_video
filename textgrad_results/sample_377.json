    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 10)]\nOption: E\nReason: The question asks for the next step to navigate to a specific balcony on the top floor of the building ahead, where white clothes are hanging. From the initial position (0:00-0:10), the building is directly ahead. Upon close inspection of the top floor, the balcony with white clothes is located towards the right side of the building. To accurately approach this specific target, the most logical immediate step for the agent is to adjust its orientation. Turning slightly right (Option E) would align the agent's heading directly towards the target balcony, facilitating a more precise and efficient subsequent forward and upward movement. This initial alignment ensures the agent is pointed correctly towards the destination before covering distance. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with this analysis.",
