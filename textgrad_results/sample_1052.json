    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 8)]\nOption: C\nReason: At the initial position (0:00-0:08), the video displays a view of a community with multiple tall residential buildings and a central playground. While several building entrances are visible, none of the buildings are explicitly labeled or identifiable as \"Building 4\". Without any identifying markers, it is impossible to determine which, if any, of the visible entrances belongs to Building 4. Therefore, the specific destination (entrance to Building 4) is not identifiable within the field of view. The provided answer is correct as it aligns with this observation.",
