    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The playground is visible next to the building ahead, and approaching the small building next to the playground will help in navigating towards the destination.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 9)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video starts with the agent's perspective from a rooftop. The question asks to navigate to the playground next to the building ahead. From 0:02 to 0:09, the camera pans down and to the left, revealing a playground area on the ground level, adjacent to the building. Directly next to this playground, a small building or structure is clearly visible. To get from the initial position on the rooftop to the playground, the agent would need to descend. Once on the ground level, or as a target for descent, approaching this small building, which is immediately adjacent to the playground, serves as a direct and logical next step to reach the destination. The provided answer correctly identifies this small building as the appropriate next approach.",
