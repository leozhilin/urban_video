    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current location is directly above the bus stop, as indicated by the visible bus stop structure and its position relative to the road and buildings.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 9)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video frames show an aerial view where the camera is positioned directly above the bus stop. The bus stop structure (a small shelter with a bench) is clearly visible beneath the camera's viewpoint, located on the sidewalk next to the road and in front of the pinkish building. As the video progresses, the camera descends, getting closer to the bus stop, confirming that the \"current location\" (the camera's perspective) is indeed directly above the destination. Therefore, the provided answer is correct.",
