  "ground_truth": "B",
  "textgrad_result": {
    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The current position is at the top of the adjacent hill, which means the agent is now above the modern glass-walled office building that was initially approached. Therefore, the positional relationship indicates that the agent is located above the building.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 214)]\nOption: E\nReason: The movement instructions state that the agent first moves towards a modern glass-walled office building and then flies to the top of an adjacent hill. The video begins with an aerial view of buildings, then pans to reveal a city skyline with several tall, modern glass-walled buildings (e.g., prominently seen from 0:12 to 0:59). Towards the end of the video (from approximately 1:50 onwards), the drone is clearly positioned high above a forested hill, looking down. From this vantage point on the hill, the city and its buildings, including the modern glass-walled office building, are situated at a lower elevation. Therefore, at its current position (the top of the adjacent hill), the agent is located above the modern glass-walled office building. The provided answer is correct.",
