  "question": "Question: If you do not go down the alley, but choose to ascend immediately, can you still reach the roof of the low-rise building on the other side of the intersection?\n\nChoice: A. If I ascend immediately, I can complete the mission because I can clearly see the destination, but the alternative will take longer.  \n           B. If I ascend immediately, I may not be able to complete the mission as I may lose sight and direction.  \n           C. If I ascend immediately, I can complete the mission because I can gain a higher vantage point faster, whereas the alternative requires less time.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: Ascending immediately provides a clear line of sight to the destination, allowing for efficient navigation to the roof of the low-rise building on the other side of the intersection. This approach leverages the higher vantage point to ensure the mission can be completed effectively, although it might take longer compared to an optimal ground route.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15)]\nOption: A\nReason: From the beginning of the video until 15 seconds, the camera ascends, providing a clear view of the destination building. This suggests that ascending immediately would allow the agent to see the destination and potentially complete the mission, although the path might be longer than an optimal ground route. The video shows the destination is visible from a higher vantage point.\n",
