At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. What are you doing now?  \nchoose:  \nA. I fly to the left side of the tall skyscraper.  \nB. I go straight to the tall brown building.  \nC. I go straight to the end of the road.  \nD. I fly towards the T-shaped intersection near the sea.  \nE. I turn left.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The current frame shows a view that aligns with the instruction to \"turn left\" after reaching a specific point near the tall skyscraper, as indicated by the change in direction and perspective in the sequence of images.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(03:59, 04:00)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instructions state: \"...continue straight towards the water. stop one block away from the water. turn left. fly to the left of the tall sky scraper...\". The video shows the agent completing the instruction to \"stop one block away from the water\" around 03:50-03:59. Immediately after, from 03:59 to 04:00, the agent begins to turn left, which directly corresponds to the next instruction \"turn left\". Therefore, the agent is currently turning left. The provided answer correctly identifies the action as \"turn left\" (Option E). However, its reason incorrectly states that this turn is \"after reaching a specific point near the tall skyscraper\". The instruction to \"fly to the left of the tall sky scraper\" comes *after* the current \"turn left\" action, and the current turn is performed after stopping near the water, not near the skyscraper.",
