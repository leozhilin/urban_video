  "question": "Question: At the initial position, you are asked to navigate to the street light behind the bus stop. When you reach the current location, what is the direction to the destination?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am currently located above a nearby building instead of near the street light.  \nB. I am currently located slightly to the right of the street light.  \nC. I am currently located away from the bus stop, near the main road.  \nD. I am currently located to the left of the street light, near the edge of the crosswalk.  \nE. I am currently located directly behind the bus stop.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The current location is near the edge of the crosswalk, and the street light behind the bus stop is to the right, indicating that the agent is to the left of the street light.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:29, 0:31)]\nOption: D\nReason: At the current location (0:29-0:31), the agent is positioned on the sidewalk. The bus stop is visible ahead and slightly to the right of the agent's path, closer to the road. The street light specified as the destination is located behind the bus stop, further down the sidewalk, and also positioned towards the right side of the sidewalk (closer to the road). The agent's current viewpoint is more towards the left side of the sidewalk, closer to the adjacent building. Therefore, the agent is laterally to the left of the street light. Additionally, the edge of a crosswalk is clearly visible on the road directly in front of the agent's position. The provided answer's reasoning aligns with this observation.",
