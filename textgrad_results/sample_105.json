    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The video shows a bird's-eye view of a road with a bus stop on the right side. To navigate to the nearby bus stop, the logical next step is to turn right, as the bus stop is located on the right side of the road in the direction the agent is currently facing.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:50, 2:40)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video transitions from a high-altitude view to a closer, overhead view of a city street. From approximately 1:50 onwards, the drone hovers directly above a bus stop, clearly identifiable by the shelter and the Chinese characters \"\u516c\u4ea4\u8f66\u7ad9\" (Bus Stop) painted on the road. This bus stop is located on the right side of the road from the perspective of an agent moving along the street in the direction of traffic flow (which appears to be from left to right in the overhead view, or generally away from the initial drone position). Therefore, to navigate to this nearby bus stop, the logical next step for an agent on the road would be to turn right to access the bus stop area. The provided answer correctly identifies the bus stop's location relative to the road and infers the appropriate action. The phrase \"what\u2019s next for the parking lot across the street\" is not directly relevant to the action of reaching the bus stop, as the video does not show any specific \"next\" event for the parking area, but the core task is to reach the bus stop.",
