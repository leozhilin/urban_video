  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [taking off and turning left. again turning right and coming down near a building. turning left and going straight. reaching top of the building. turning right and slightly coming down to the sea level. going straight and slight right turn. passing in between buildings and slight right turn and going straight.]. At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of the next steps, what is your best next step?  \nchoose:  \nA. I go up and turn right.  \nB. I descend and fly forward.  \nC. I fly forward and through the building.  \nD. I turn left and go up.  \nE. I turn right and descend.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The navigation instruction indicates that the next step after reaching the top of the building is to turn right and slightly come down to the sea level. However, since the agent is currently at the initial position and the first action in the instructions is \"taking off and turning left,\" the best next step from the initial position would be to go up (take off) and turn left. Therefore, option D, which involves going up and turning left, aligns with the first part of the given instructions.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1)]\nOption: D\nReason: The question asks for the best next step from the initial position based on the provided navigation instructions. The initial position is shown at the beginning of the video (0-1s). The very first part of the navigation instruction is \"taking off and turning left.\" \"Taking off\" implies moving upwards. Therefore, the first action the agent should take is to go up and turn left. Option D, \"I turn left and go up,\" perfectly matches this initial instruction. The provided answer correctly identifies the initial position and the first instruction, leading to the correct choice of Option D.",
