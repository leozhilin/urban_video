  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [rise from the concrete and turn right. fly over the middle of the street until you reach the buildings on the left with the short concrete wall like structure around them. turn left right beside the buildings and fly along beside them. when you get to the middle darker brown building then angle straight up and fly toward the top of the building. before you get to the top turn right and begin to level off. fly toward the building with the half pipe or half circle design on the edge of the roof. when you get to the half circle then turn left and downward and fly toward the red roof of the smaller building beside the one you climbed. stop well before you get to the roof.]. You move according to a series of movement instructions. What are you doing now?  \nchoose:  \nA. I fly straight up and towards the top of the building.  \nB. I fly towards a building with a half-pipe or semi-circle design on the edge of the roof.  \nC. I lift out of the concrete and turn right.  \nD. I turn left next to the building and fly along the side of the building.  \nE. I fly across the middle of the street until I reach above the red roof of a low building.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The sequence of images shows the agent flying over a street, turning beside buildings, and then approaching a building with a distinctive half-pipe or semi-circle design on its roof. This matches the part of the instruction that directs the agent to \"fly toward the building with the half pipe or half circle design on the edge of the roof.\" Therefore, the current action aligns with option B.",

Then, the agent flies over the middle of the street until it reaches the buildings on the left with the short concrete wall like structure around them. The agent turns left right beside the buildings and flies along beside them. The agent angles straight up and flies toward the top of the building with the half pipe or half circle design on the edge of the roof. Therefore, the current action aligns with option B.",
