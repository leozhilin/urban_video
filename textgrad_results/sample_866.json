When you reach the current location, what is your relative position to the destination?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am currently located directly above the store with the green billboard.  \nB.

I am currently located on the sidewalk in front of a row of stores at ground level, but the location of the store with the green sign is unknown.  \nE.

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The agent is currently on the same side of the street as the store with the green billboard but appears to be further down the street from it, as indicated by the perspective and distance in the final frames.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:36, 0:42)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video transitions from an aerial view to a first-person perspective at ground level. In the final frames (0:38-0:42), the agent is clearly on a sidewalk, facing a building with several storefronts. A prominent blue/green billboard, which reads \"\u7eff\u5730\u8d85\u5e02\" (Greenland Supermarket), is visible on the left side of the building's facade. This confirms that the agent is on the same side of the street as the store with the green billboard. While the agent is not necessarily positioned directly in front of the store's main entrance, they are along the same stretch of sidewalk where the store is located, which can be interpreted as \"further down the street\" from a precise point, but still within the immediate vicinity and on the correct side. Options A, B, and C are incorrect as the agent is at ground level, not above or across the street. Option D is incorrect because the location of the store with the green sign is clearly visible. Therefore, option E is the most accurate description of the agent's relative position.",
