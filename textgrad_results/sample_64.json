    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: After turning slightly left and aiming towards the building, the tall building appears larger and more detailed in the subsequent frames, indicating that the distance between the agent and the tall building is decreasing.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 5), (45, 50)]\nOption: [B]\nReason: Initially, the tall building is far away and partially obscured by trees. As the camera moves and turns slightly left, aiming towards the building, the building becomes larger and more prominent in the frame. This indicates that the distance between the camera (representing the agent) and the tall building is decreasing.",
