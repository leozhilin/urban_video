    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The initial frames show a view of tall buildings across the street on the left, which are the most relevant objects in view since the balcony with the green screen is not visible. These buildings are prominently featured in the early part of the video sequence.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 7)]\nOption: C\nReason: The initial frames of the video (0-7 seconds) show a view of tall buildings across the street on the left. The question asks what is the most relevant object in view if the balcony with the green screen is not visible. Since the green screen balcony is not visible in these initial frames, the tall buildings across the street on the left are the most relevant objects in view. The playground is visible later in the video, but not in the initial frames.",
