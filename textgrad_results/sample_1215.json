  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [taking off and turning left. again turning right and coming down near a building. turning left and going straight. reaching top of the building. turning right and slightly coming down to the sea level. going straight and slight right turn. passing in between buildings and slight right turn and going straight.]. At the initial position, you are asked to navigate according to a series of movement instructions. What is the Landmark Position of the sea surface when you reach your current position?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am on the ocean floor.  \nB. I am on the sea.  \nC. I am on the left side of the sea.  \nD. I am at sea.  \nE. I am located on the right side of the sea.  ",

  "ground_truth": "C",
  "textgrad_result": {
    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The sequence of movements leads to a position where the sea is visible on the left side, as indicated by the frames showing the sea on the left while the agent is navigating through the buildings. Therefore, the landmark position of the sea surface when reaching the current position is on the left side.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 34)]\nOption: C\nReason: The navigation instructions describe a complex path.\n1.  **Initial position (0:00-0:04):** The agent is on a rooftop, and the sea is directly in front/slightly to the right.\n2.  **\"taking off and turning left\" (0:04-0:08):** The agent ascends and turns left. The sea is still visible, now more to the right side of the view.\n3.  **\"again turning right and coming down near a building\" (0:08-0:12):** The agent turns right and descends, approaching a large building. The sea is still on the right.\n4.  **\"turning left and going straight\" (0:12-0:16):** The agent turns left and moves straight, now facing away from the sea and towards other buildings. The sea is no longer directly visible.\n5.  **\"reaching top of the building\" (0:16-0:20):** The agent ascends, moving up between buildings. The sea is not visible.\n6.  **\"turning right and slightly coming down to the sea level\" (0:20-0:24):** The agent turns right and descends. The sea is still not visible.\n7.  **\"going straight and slight right turn\" (0:24-0:28):** The agent moves straight and makes a slight right turn, still among buildings.\n8.  **\"passing in between buildings and slight right turn and going straight\" (0:28-0:34):** The agent continues to navigate between buildings. Around 0:31, the view opens up, and the sea becomes clearly visible on the **left side** of the agent's perspective. This remains the case until the end of the video (0:34), which represents the \"current position.\"\n\nTherefore, at the current position, the sea surface is on the left side of the agent. The provided answer is correct.",
