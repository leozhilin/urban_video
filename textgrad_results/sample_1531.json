You move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best choice for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I fly forward and then rise.  \nB. I drop down and turn right.  \nC. I fly forward while rising.  \nD. I turn left and descend.  \nE. I rotate the camera downward.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: Based on the navigation instruction, the next step involves moving forward and getting down beside Charlie's Chocolate building, which suggests a descent and a turn to align with the building's position. Therefore, dropping down and turning right is the most appropriate action to take next.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(2:28, 2:35)]\nOption: B\nReason: The navigation instruction states, \"now move forward and get down and besidecharlies chocolate building\". At the 2:28 mark, the agent is flying forward at a high altitude, and the \"Charlie's Chocolate\" building is visible to its right. To fulfill the instruction \"get down and beside charlies chocolate building\", the agent needs to descend (drop down) and adjust its horizontal position to be alongside the building, which would involve turning or moving to the right. The video from 2:32 to 2:35 shows the agent beginning to descend and move slightly to the right, aligning with the building. Therefore, \"dropping down and turning right\" is the most appropriate next step. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with this analysis.",
