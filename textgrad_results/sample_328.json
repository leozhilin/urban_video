    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 19)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video is shot from an aerial perspective. From approximately 0:08 onwards, the camera pans and zooms, bringing the pond and rockery into clear view directly beneath its viewpoint. The \"current location\" refers to the camera's position. Since the pond and rockery are visible directly below the camera throughout the latter half of the video, the camera is positioned directly above the destination. The provided answer correctly identifies this relationship.",
