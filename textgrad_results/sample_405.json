    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The agent needs to navigate to the roof of a building three floors ahead. Given the current perspective and the need to reach a specific destination, the most logical next step is to fly forward towards the target building. This aligns with the goal of reaching the specified location efficiently.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1:14)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video begins with an aerial perspective, showing the target building located ahead and below the agent's initial position. To navigate to the roof of a building \"three floors ahead,\" the agent must primarily move forward to cover the horizontal distance to the building. The video clearly depicts this forward motion, as the building progressively gets closer and larger in the frame (e.g., from 0:00 to 0:30). While the agent is also simultaneously declining (moving downwards) to reach the roof's altitude, \"flying forward\" is the fundamental and most direct action to reach the specified building's horizontal location. The provided answer correctly identifies \"I fly forward\" as the most logical next step to achieve the goal of reaching the building efficiently.",
