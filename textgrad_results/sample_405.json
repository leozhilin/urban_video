    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The agent needs to navigate to the roof of a building three floors ahead. Given the current perspective, the next logical step is to fly forward towards the target building's roof. This aligns with the goal of reaching the specified destination efficiently.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 12)]\nOption: A\nReason: From the initial position, the agent needs to first rise to gain altitude before flying forward. The video shows the initial position is at ground level, so the first step is to rise.",
    "feedback": "### 1. Key Disagreements\n\n#### 1.1 Initial Action: Rise vs. Fly Forward\n- **Original Answer Viewpoint**: The next logical step is to fly forward (Option C) towards the target building's roof.\n- **Evaluation Viewpoint**: The first step should be to rise (Option A) to gain altitude before flying forward.\n- **Visual Evidence Support**: The evaluation mentions that the video shows the initial position is at ground level, which supports the need to rise first. However, this specific detail from the video is not mentioned in the original answer.\n\n#### 1.2 Sequence of Actions\n- **Original Answer Viewpoint**: Flying forward is prioritized as the immediate next step.\n- **Evaluation Viewpoint**: Rising to gain altitude is prioritized before any forward movement.\n- **Visual Evidence Support**: The evaluation suggests that visual evidence (the video) indicates the starting point is at ground level, necessitating an initial rise. This aspect is not addressed in the original answer.\n\n### 2. Required Verifications\n\n#### 2.1 Initial Position and Altitude\n- **Specific Visual Evidence Needed**: Confirm the initial altitude of the agent. If the agent starts at ground level (as suggested by the evaluation), this would validate the need to rise first.\n- **Additional Frames or Perspectives**: A frame showing the agent's starting position relative to the ground and nearby structures would be helpful.\n- **Kind of Visual Information**: A clear view of the agent's altitude at the start, possibly with a reference to the ground level or a height indicator.\n\n#### 2.2 Immediate Surroundings and Obstacles\n- **Specific Visual Evidence Needed**: Check for any obstacles or features that might require gaining altitude before moving forward.\n- **Additional Frames or Perspectives**: Frames showing the path directly ahead from the starting position, including any potential obstacles.\n- **Kind of Visual Information**: A clear line-of-sight view from the starting position to the target building, highlighting any intermediate objects or barriers.\n\n### 3. Resolution Path\n\n#### 3.1 Verify Initial Altitude\n- **Specific Steps**: Review the initial frame(s) of the video to determine the exact starting altitude of the agent.\n- **Priority**: High - This is crucial as it directly impacts the first action (rise or fly forward).\n- **Additional Evidence Needed**: A static or dynamic view of the agent's starting position with a clear indication of its altitude.\n\n#### 3.2 Assess Path Clearances\n- **Specific Steps**: Examine the path between the starting position and the target building for any obstacles that might necessitate an initial rise.\n- **Priority**: Medium - While important, this is secondary to verifying the initial altitude.\n- **Additional Evidence Needed**: Sequential frames or a continuous video segment showing the path from start to target, focusing on any potential obstructions.\n\n#### 3.3 Re-evaluate Action Sequence\n- **Specific Steps**: Based on the verified initial altitude and path clearance, re-evaluate the sequence of actions (rise, then fly forward or directly fly forward).\n- **Priority**: Low - This step follows from the previous verifications and helps finalize the correct sequence.\n- **Additional Evidence Needed**: A synthesized view combining the initial position and the path to the target, allowing a holistic assessment of the required actions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe primary disagreement centers on whether the initial action should be to rise or fly forward, hinging on the agent's starting altitude and the presence of obstacles. To resolve this, detailed visual evidence of the starting position and the path to the target is necessary. Prioritizing the verification of the initial altitude will provide a clear basis for determining the correct sequence of actions.",
    "final_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The agent starts at ground level, and the first step should be to rise to gain altitude before navigating forward to the roof of the building three floors ahead. This ensures a clear path and avoids potential obstacles."
