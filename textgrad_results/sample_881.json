  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [rise from the concrete and turn right. fly over the middle of the street until you reach the buildings on the left with the short concrete wall like structure around them. turn left right beside the buildings and fly along beside them. when you get to the middle darker brown building then angle straight up and fly toward the top of the building. before you get to the top turn right and begin to level off. fly toward the building with the half pipe or half circle design on the edge of the roof. when you get to the half circle then turn left and downward and fly toward the red roof of the smaller building beside the one you climbed. stop well before you get to the roof.]. At the initial position, you are asked to navigate according to a series of movement instructions. What is the Landmark Position of the intersection with the high-rise building when you reach your current location?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am located above the high-rise building bypass intersection.  \nB. I am located on the left side of the high-rise building bypass intersection.  \nC. I am under the intersection next to the high-rise building.  \nD. I am located on the right side of the high-rise building bypass intersection.  \nE. I am on the ground at the intersection of a high-rise building.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The agent has moved along the street and is now positioned on the left side of the high-rise building bypass intersection, as indicated by the perspective showing the buildings to the right and the open street ahead.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 39)]\nOption: B\nReason: The navigation instruction states to \"rise from the concrete and turn right. fly over the middle of the street until you reach the buildings on the left... turn left right beside the buildings and fly along beside them.\" The video shows the agent executing this sequence. From 0:00 to 0:11, the agent flies along the initial street (the bypass). At approximately 0:11-0:12, the agent turns left, moving onto a new street. This point marks the \"high-rise building bypass intersection.\" From 0:12 to 0:39, the agent is flying along this new street, moving away from the intersection. Since the agent made a left turn at this intersection, its current position (at 0:39) is on the street that branches off to the left from the main bypass. Therefore, the agent is located on the left side of the high-rise building bypass intersection. The visual perspective at 0:39 shows the agent flying down a street with high-rise buildings on both sides and an open street ahead, consistent with having turned onto a new street and moving away from the intersection. The provided answer's reasoning aligns with this interpretation.",
