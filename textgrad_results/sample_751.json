At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I turn right and go up.  \nB. I descend and then fly forward.  \nC. I rotate the camera downward.  \nD. I turn left and descend.  \nE. I fly forward.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"take off from the sea and take left,\" which implies that the first action should be to move forward (fly forward) from the current position, aligning with the starting point of the given navigation instructions.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15)]\nOption: E\nReason: The instruction is to take off from the sea and take left. From the initial position (0-15s), the agent needs to fly forward to take off from the sea.",
