    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The provided frames do not show any \"Zhengyong Yishang Dance\" billboard or a platform area related to it. The environment depicted is an urban setting with buildings and roads, but no specific destination matching the description is visible. Therefore, the destination is not within the current field of view.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 9)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video frames from 00:00 to 00:09 show a simplified, block-like representation of an urban environment from an aerial perspective. There are no detailed textures, signs, or specific landmarks visible. Crucially, there is no billboard with the text \"Zhengyong Yishang Dance\" or any identifiable \"platform area\" associated with such a billboard within the field of view. Therefore, the destination described in the question is not within sight at the initial position. The provided answer is correct and its reasoning accurately reflects the visual evidence.",
