    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The sequence of images shows the agent initially moving straight down the bridge, stopping halfway, turning right, and going over water. After looking left and going under the bridge, the agent turns right and proceeds forward back to the street. The current action aligns with stopping at the intersection and looking to the right, as indicated by the navigation instruction and the urban environment in the latest frames.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 257), (257, 314)]\nOption: [A]\nReason: The video shows the agent moving down the bridge (0:00-0:40), then going under the bridge (2:10-2:30), and finally turning right and moving forward on the street (2:50-3:14). The final frames show the agent stopping at an intersection. This aligns with option A: \"I turn right and walk forward back to the street, stopping at the intersection and looking to the right.\" The provided answer is correct.",
