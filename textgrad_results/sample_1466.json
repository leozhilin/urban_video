    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The stone statue to the right of the entrance is not visible within the current field of view. The images show an aerial perspective of a building and its surroundings, but no stone statue can be seen in the provided frames.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 12)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video presents an aerial perspective of a city environment, not a first-person perspective from the ground as implied by the question. From this high-angle view, while there are small, indistinct objects in the plaza area near what appears to be the building's entrance (e.g., around 00:04), these objects are too small and lack sufficient detail to be definitively identified as \"stone statues.\" Given the aerial nature of the footage, a small ground-level stone statue would likely not be clearly visible or recognizable. Therefore, a recognizable stone statue is not within the current field of view. The provided answer correctly identifies the aerial perspective and the absence of a clearly visible stone statue.",
