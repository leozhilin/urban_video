At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I go up and turn right.  \nB. I descend and fly forward.  \nC. I fly forward while rotating the camera downward.  \nD. I turn left and go up.  \nE. I turn right and fly forward.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The navigation instruction starts with \"taking off and turning left,\" which implies that the initial action should be to ascend (go up) and then make a left turn. Among the given options, \"I turn left and go up\" (Option D) aligns with this initial step of the instructions.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1)]\nOption: D\nReason: The navigation instruction given at the initial position clearly states \"taking off and turning left\". \"Taking off\" implies an upward movement, which is synonymous with \"go up\". Therefore, the first actions required are to go up and turn left. Option D, \"I turn left and go up\", perfectly matches these initial instructions. The provided answer correctly identifies this alignment.",
