    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: Increasing the viewing angle and moving outward after rising from the center of the basketball court allows for a broader perspective, revealing more of the surrounding buildings and streets. This movement provides a comprehensive view of the urban landscape, including the layout of the roads, the density of the buildings, and the overall structure of the neighborhood.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15), (50, 102)]\nOption: [C]\nReason: From 0 to 15 seconds, the video shows the drone rising from the center of the basketball court. As it rises, the viewing angle increases, and the drone moves outward, revealing more of the surrounding buildings and streets. From 50 to 102 seconds, the video shows the drone moving further away from the basketball court, providing a comprehensive view of the urban landscape, including the layout of the roads, the density of the buildings, and the overall structure of the neighborhood. Therefore, the reason for increasing the viewing angle and moving outward is to reveal more of the surrounding buildings and streets.",
