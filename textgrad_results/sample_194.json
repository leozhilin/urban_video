    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The current perspective shows that the agent is approaching an intersection and is slightly to the right of the road leading to it, as indicated by the layout of the buildings and roads in the frames.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15), (0:55, 1:00), (1:47, 1:52)]\nOption: A\nReason: At the initial position (0:00-0:06), the camera is positioned near a set of buildings. As the camera pans left (0:07-0:15), a wide road becomes visible. The buildings where the agent is located are clearly on the right side of this road. Further down this road, a large intersection is visible, becoming very clear as the drone ascends (e.g., 0:55-1:00 and prominently at 1:47-1:52). Therefore, the agent is currently facing the general direction of the intersection and is located slightly to the right of the road that leads directly to it. The provided answer accurately describes the agent's position and orientation relative to the largest intersection.",
