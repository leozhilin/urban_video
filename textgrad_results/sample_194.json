  "question": "Question: At the initial position, you are asked to navigate to the largest intersection nearby. When you reach the current location, what is your direction to the destination?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am currently facing the intersection and located slightly to the right of the road leading to the intersection.  \nB. I am currently located behind the intersection, looking back at a group of high-rise buildings.  \nC. I am currently located directly above the intersection.  \nD. I am currently located on the left side of the intersection, with tall buildings blocking the view.  \nE. I am currently located on the far right side of the intersection, over a residential area.

    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The current perspective shows a direct view of the intersection ahead, with the agent slightly to the right of the road leading to it. This aligns with option A, indicating that the agent is facing the intersection and positioned slightly to the right.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15)]\nOption: A\nReason: At the initial position (around 0:00-0:05), the camera is facing a building. As the camera pans left from 0:05 to 0:15, a large intersection becomes clearly visible in the distance, along a main road. This indicates that from the agent's initial perspective, the intersection is generally ahead and slightly to the left. The agent is positioned on a raised area (like a sidewalk or plaza) to the right of the main road that leads directly to this intersection. Therefore, the agent is \"facing the intersection\" (in the general forward direction) and is \"located slightly to the right of the road leading to the intersection.\" This aligns perfectly with option A. Options B, C, D, and E are incorrect as the intersection is not behind, the agent is not directly above it, not on its left side with a blocked view, nor on the far right over a residential area at the initial position.",
