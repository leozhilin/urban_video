    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The sequence of images shows the agent navigating through a cityscape and approaching the Golden Gate Bridge. The final frames indicate that the agent is positioned to the left side of the bridge when facing it, as the bridge is visible on the right side of the frame. Therefore, the agent is located on the left side of the Golden Gate Bridge.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 37)]\nOption: D\nReason: The navigation instruction provided at the initial position explicitly states, \"turn slightly left go high of the building and cross the building there will be a river contains small bridge. **slightly go left of that bridge** slightly go down of the river and look up , go up in that place cover the entire location.\" This instruction dictates the agent's intended final position relative to the Golden Gate Bridge. Therefore, if the agent successfully follows this instruction, it would be located on the left side of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nThe provided answer's reasoning, \"the bridge is visible on the right side of the frame,\" is incorrect. In the video segments where the Golden Gate Bridge is clearly visible (approximately 00:13 to 00:37), the bridge consistently appears on the *left side* of the frame. If the bridge is on the left side of the agent's view, the agent is positioned on the *right side* of the bridge. However, the question asks about the landmark position *after* navigating according to the instruction, which includes the command to \"slightly go left of that bridge.\"",
