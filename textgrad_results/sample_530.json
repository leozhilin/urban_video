    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The main entrance is not visible within the current field of view. The images show a progression towards an area that appears to be the main entrance, but at the initial position (the first image), the entrance itself is not in sight. The agent seems to be navigating through a complex of buildings and open spaces before reaching the entrance.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 0)]\nOption: B\nReason: At the initial position (00:00), the video displays a high-level, abstract map view of a city. In this view, there is no discernible or clearly marked \"main entrance.\" The subsequent frames zoom in and reveal more detailed structures, suggesting that the main entrance is a specific feature that becomes visible only as the perspective changes and zooms closer. Therefore, at the very first frame, the destination (main entrance) is not within sight in a recognizable form. The provided answer correctly identifies this.",
