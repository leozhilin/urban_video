    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The initial position shows a view of the street and buildings, but the window directly above the central ALL-STAR cafe is not within the field of view. The perspective is at street level and does not provide a view of the upper windows of the building.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 0)]\nOption: C\nReason: At the initial position (00:00), the camera is facing straight down a wide street, showing buildings far ahead and to the sides. The \"CENTRAL ALL-STAR cafe\" and the building it is part of are located to the left of this initial field of view and only become visible later in the video as the camera pans (specifically, the cafe sign is clearly visible from 00:36 onwards). Therefore, at the initial position, the destination (the window directly above the central ALL-STAR cafe) is not within sight. The provided answer is correct.",
