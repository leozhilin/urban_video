    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The sequence of images shows that the agent has flown over the park, as indicated by the aerial view of the park and surrounding buildings. This aligns with the instruction to \"fly on top of the park,\" confirming that the landmark position relative to the park is overhead.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 123)]\nOption: C\nReason: The navigation instruction explicitly states \"fly on top of the park\". The video frames from approximately 0:20 onwards show the agent ascending and then providing an aerial view of a large park with trees and a lake. This visual evidence confirms that the agent is positioned directly over the park, fulfilling the instruction. Therefore, the landmark position between the agent and the park is \"over the park\". The provided answer is correct.",
