  "question": "Question: You are navigating to [the roof of the three floors ahead]. What is the correct summary of your trajectory from the beginning to your current position?  \nChoice:  \nA. I start from above the park, descend to street level, then move toward the three-story building and ascend to my current location.  \nB. I start from the street, move toward the park, then turn to the three floors and rise to my current location.  \nC. I start from the park, move toward the street, then rise to the height above the high-rise building, move toward the third floor, and finally reach my current location.  \nD. I start from above the main road, fly forward and descend, and reach my current position.  \nE. I start from a position above a high-rise building, move downward toward the street, and then move to a three-story building to reach my current location.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The trajectory starts from a high vantage point above a high-rise building, moves downward toward the street level, and then approaches a three-story building to reach the current position on its roof. This matches the description in option E.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 18)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video begins with an aerial view from a very high vantage point, clearly above the surrounding high-rise buildings. From this initial position, the camera steadily moves downward and forward, descending towards the street level and the central three-story building. The trajectory then continues to approach this three-story building, with the implied goal being its roof, as stated in the question. Option E accurately summarizes this movement: \"I start from a position above a high-rise building, move downward toward the street, and then move to a three-story building to reach my current location.\" The provided answer's reasoning aligns perfectly with this observation.",
