  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [Raise the drone altitude, then change the camera gimbal from overhead to normal, fly towards the road, fly towards the sun after reaching the sky above the road, and finally turn right towards the residential building.]. You are moving according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I fly forward.  \nB. I descend and turn left.  \nC. I fly forward while rotating the camera upward.  \nD. I turn right and rotate the camera down.  \nE. I rotate the camera up and down.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The next step should be to fly forward as the drone has already reached a high altitude and is positioned above the road. Flying forward will allow it to continue towards the sun, which is part of the navigation instruction.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 115)]\nOption: A\nReason: The navigation instructions are: \"Raise the drone altitude, then change the camera gimbal from overhead to normal, fly towards the road, fly towards the sun after reaching the sky above the road, and finally turn right towards the residential building.\"\n\nLet's analyze the drone's progress in the video:\n*   **0:00 - 0:35**: The drone is initially at a low altitude with an overhead camera view. It gradually raises its altitude. By around 0:35, it has reached a significant altitude.\n*   **0:35 - 0:45**: The camera gimbal changes from an overhead view to a normal, forward-facing view.\n*   **0:45 - 0:55**: The drone flies forward, moving towards the main road visible in the distance. By approximately 0:55, the drone is positioned above the road.\n*   **0:55 - 1:15**: After reaching the sky above the road, the drone continues to fly forward. The sun is visible in the direction of flight, indicating it is flying towards the sun as per the instruction.\n\nAt the end of the video (1:15), the drone has completed raising altitude, changing the camera, and flying towards and reaching the road. It is currently executing the instruction \"fly towards the sun after reaching the sky above the road\". Therefore, the best next step is to continue flying forward to fulfill this instruction. The final instruction, \"turn right towards the residential building,\" is to be performed *after* flying towards the sun.\n\nThe provided answer correctly identifies that the drone has reached a high altitude and is above the road, and that flying forward is the next step to continue towards the sun. My analysis confirms this.",
