  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [step rise up until the two building appears. go towards the building crossing over pond. go decent down slightly and take round turn. head towards twin building and take right turn near the right building. take round turn above billboard cross the pond once again. head towards the intersection and take left turn near the grey building. cross over the intersection and head towards the second tall building on left. go beside that building and land in front of billboard.]. At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. When you reach your current location, what is your Landmark Position from the water?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am on the right side of the water.  \nB. I am located below the water surface.  \nC. I am located on the left side of the water.  \nD. I am above the water.  \nE. I am behind the water.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The current location, as indicated by the final frames, shows a view where the water is in front of the agent's position, meaning the agent is behind the water relative to the direction they are facing.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:20, 1:29)]\nOption: E\nReason: The final frames of the video (from 1:20 to 1:29) show the agent in an elevated position, looking over a park and a body of water towards a city skyline. The water is clearly visible in the foreground and midground of the agent's view, meaning it is \"in front\" of the agent. When a landmark (like the water) is positioned in front of the observer, the observer is considered to be \"behind\" that landmark relative to their line of sight. The navigation instructions also indicate the agent crosses the pond twice, which would place it back on a side where the pond is in front of its view towards the city. Therefore, the agent is behind the water. The provided answer's reasoning is correct.",
