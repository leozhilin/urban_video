    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The initial frames show a view from a high vantage point overlooking buildings and roads, but there is no visible bus stop in the field of view. The perspective does not include any immediate signs of a bus stop such as a shelter, bench, or bus stop sign. Therefore, the destination is not within sight at the current location.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 12)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video begins with an aerial view from a high vantage point, showing tall buildings and a distant cityscape. The camera pans across the skyline and then gradually descends and zooms in on the street level much later in the video. At the initial position (approximately 0:00 to 0:12), there is no visible bus stop, bus stop sign, or shelter in the field of view. The destination only becomes visible much later in the video (around 1:15-1:18) when the camera has changed its perspective to an overhead view of the street. Therefore, at the initial location, the bus stop is not within sight. The provided answer is correct.",
