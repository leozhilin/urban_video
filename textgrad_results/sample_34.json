    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The initial frames show a view from a high vantage point overlooking buildings and roads, but there is no visible bus stop in the field of view. The perspective does not include any immediate signs or structures that resemble a bus stop.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 6)]\nOption: D\nReason: At the initial position (0:00-0:06), the video shows a close-up view of a building from a high vantage point, then pans slightly to reveal a hazy city skyline. There is no bus stop visible in the field of view during these initial frames. The bus stop only becomes visible much later in the video (around 1:15-1:16) after the camera has significantly changed its perspective and zoomed out to show the street level. Therefore, at the initial position, the destination is not within sight. The provided answer is correct.",
