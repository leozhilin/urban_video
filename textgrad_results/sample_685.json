  "question": "Question: What is the correct summary of your trajectory from the start to your current location?  \nChoice:  \nA. I start from a high-rise building, proceed along the road, and then descend to the intersection.  \nB. I start from the left side of the road, move forward, hover near the intersection, and then land.  \nC. I started from the parking lot, flew over the building, crossed the road, and am currently hovering over the intersection.  \nD. I start from the roof of the building, fly forward along the street, and reach my current position above the intersection.  \nE. I start from a place far away from the intersection, fly forward along the street, and gradually reduce my height when approaching the intersection.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The sequence of images shows a continuous aerial view starting from a higher altitude and moving forward along a street. The perspective suggests that the agent (likely a drone) began at a higher position, such as on top of a building, and flew forward along the street towards the intersection, which matches the description in option D.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 6)]\nOption: D\nReason: From the beginning of the video to 6 seconds, the camera is at a high altitude, and the perspective is moving forward along the street. This suggests that the agent started from a high position, such as the roof of a building, and flew forward along the street towards the intersection. Therefore, option D is the correct answer. The provided answer is correct.\n",
