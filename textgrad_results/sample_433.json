    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The navigation instruction indicates that the agent should pass through several buildings, see a lake, and fly over the bridge in the middle of the lake. Given the current view, the agent has already passed through the buildings and is now positioned such that the lake is no longer in front but rather behind the agent's current location. Therefore, the lake is behind the agent.",
