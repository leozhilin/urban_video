    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The navigation instruction indicates that the agent should pass through several buildings, see a lake, and fly over the bridge in the middle of the lake. Given the current view, the agent has already passed through the buildings and is now positioned such that the lake is behind them, as they are looking towards more buildings and not at the lake or bridge. Therefore, the lake must be behind the agent's current position.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 29)]\nOption: C\nReason: The navigation instruction states to \"Pass through several buildings in front of agent, see a lake and fly over the bridge in the middle of the lake.\" At the initial position (around 0:00-0:05), the lake and a bridge are visible in the distance, beyond the initial set of buildings, indicating they are in front of the agent. As the video progresses, the agent moves forward, passing *through* these buildings (from approximately 0:05 to 0:29). By the end of the video, the agent is positioned among the buildings, and the view is now looking towards other buildings or the opposite direction from where the lake was initially seen. Since the agent has passed through the buildings that were between it and the lake, the lake must now be behind the agent's current position. The provided answer correctly identifies this.",
