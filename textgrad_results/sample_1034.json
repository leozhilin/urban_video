    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The initial frames show a view of tall buildings and a cityscape, but there is no visible elevator or entrance in the field of view. The perspective is from a high vantage point overlooking the city, which does not include details of specific building entrances or elevators.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 3)]\nOption: E\nReason: The initial frames of the video (0:00-0:03) show a wide, high-angle view of a cityscape with tall buildings and roads. The perspective is from a very high vantage point, making it impossible to discern specific details like building entrances or elevators at ground level. Therefore, the elevator to the right of the entrance is not within the field of view at the initial location. The provided answer's reasoning is accurate and aligns with the visual evidence.",
