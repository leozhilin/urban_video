    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The current location shows a residential building in front, a park and swimming pool on the right, and the outer edge of the community on the left, which matches the description in option A.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:45, 1:50)]\nOption: A\nReason: The video shows the drone flying towards the outer edge of a residential area (revealed between 0:25 and 1:40, showing a river, busy road, and construction site). It then makes a half-circle turn (around 1:30 to 1:45) to face back into the residential area. At the \"current location\" after this turn (visible from approximately 1:45 to 1:50), the following can be observed:\n*   **In front of me:** A tall residential building is directly in the drone's view.\n*   **On the right:** A large green area with a swimming pool and palm trees is clearly visible, which can be described as a park and swimming pool.\n*   **On the left:** The drone has just completed a turn from the outer edge of the community (which included a construction site and a main road/river as seen earlier in the video, e.g., 0:25-0:45 and 1:30-1:40). Therefore, the outer edge of the community is indeed to the left of the current position.\nThis aligns perfectly with the description provided in Option A.",
