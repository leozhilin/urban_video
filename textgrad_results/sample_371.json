    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The goal is to navigate to a nearby bus stop. Given the current view, the bus stop is clearly visible and accessible from the current location. Approaching the bus stop itself (Option B) is the most direct and logical choice to achieve the goal of reaching the bus stop. Other options like approaching the center of the intersection, traffic light pole, roof of a building, or parking lot do not directly lead to the bus stop.",

However, as the camera pans down and shows the street level, a bus stop becomes visible across the street. The bus stop is located on the other side of the road, and it is the most direct way to reach the destination. Therefore, the agent should approach the bus stop itself.",
