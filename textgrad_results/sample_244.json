    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The initial frames show a view of a cityscape with buildings and roads, but there is no store with a green billboard visible within the field of view. The agent appears to be at a high vantage point overlooking the area, and the specific store is not in sight.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 3)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video begins with a wide, high-altitude view of a simulated cityscape. From this initial vantage point (0-3 seconds), the buildings are generic and lack specific details such as store billboards. There is no store with a green billboard visible anywhere within the field of view. The agent is too high up to discern such details. The provided answer correctly identifies that the store is not within sight at the current location.",
