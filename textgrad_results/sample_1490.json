    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The navigation instruction starts with \"takeoff from the white statue located in the park and turn left to the city show lamp post and signal and show butcher signage.\" Given that the initial position is at the white statue in the park, the best next step is to go up (takeoff) and then turn left to align with the direction towards the city features mentioned in the instructions. Therefore, option A, \"I go up and turn left,\" is the most appropriate choice to follow the given navigation instruction accurately.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 10)]\nOption: A\nReason: The navigation instruction explicitly states, \"takeoff from the white statue located in the park and turn left to the city show lamp post and signal and show butcher signage.\" The video begins at the initial position, which is at the white statue in the park. To follow the instruction, the agent must first \"takeoff\" (go up) and then \"turn left.\" Option A, \"I go up and turn left,\" directly corresponds to the initial two actions specified in the navigation instruction. The video segment from 0:00 to 0:10 visually confirms this action, as the camera moves upwards and rotates to the left, revealing the city skyline, which is consistent with the instruction to turn left towards city features. The provided answer correctly identifies and explains this.",
