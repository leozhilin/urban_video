    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"take off and move between the two buildings and towards the green tree,\" which matches the visual context of the first image where the agent is positioned between two buildings with a green tree in the distance. This is the starting point of the navigation instructions.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 9)]\nOption: E\nReason: The question asks what the agent is doing at the initial position, referring to the start of the navigation instructions. The first instruction given is \"take off and move between to the two building and towards to the green tree and move into the tree.\" The video begins at 00:00 with the agent positioned between two buildings, facing a green tree in the distance. From 00:00 to approximately 00:09, the agent is actively moving forward, between the two buildings and towards the green tree, directly following the initial part of the instruction. Therefore, option E accurately describes the action at the initial position. The provided answer is correct.",
