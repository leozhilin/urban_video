    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The elevator to the left of the entrance is not visible in the current field of view. However, the highway is clearly visible in the lower right corner of the view, making it the most relevant object mentioned in the options.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1)]\nOption: D\nReason: At the initial position (00:00), the camera is positioned high above the city, providing an aerial view. From this perspective, specific details like an \"elevator to the left of the entrance\" of a building are not visible. Therefore, the first part of option D, \"The elevator to the left of the entrance is out of my view,\" is correct. Looking at the lower right portion of the initial frame, a multi-lane highway is clearly visible, making the second part of option D, \"but I can see the highway in the lower right corner of my view,\" also accurate. Options B, C, and E describe objects that are either not present, mislocated, or not clearly identifiable in the initial field of view. The provided answer is correct.",
