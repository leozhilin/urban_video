    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The navigation instruction starts with \"ascend straight up, turn to the left, and fly past the soccer fields.\" Therefore, the best next step is to turn left and go up, which aligns with the initial part of the given instructions.",
    "evaluation": "Okay, I will analyze the question and the provided answer, and provide my own answer in the specified format.\n\n**My Analysis:**\n\nThe question asks for the best next step based on the initial navigation instruction: \"ascend straight up, turn to the left, and fly past the soccer fields.\" This clearly indicates two actions: first, go up, and second, turn left. Therefore, the best next step is to turn left and go up.\n\n**My Answer:**\n\nLocation: [(0, 5)]\nOption: [D]\nReason: The initial instruction is \"ascend straight up, turn to the left...\". This means the drone should first ascend and then turn left. Therefore, the best next step is to turn left and go up.\n\n**Evaluation of the Provided Answer:**\n\nThe provided answer is correct. It correctly identifies the initial steps from the navigation instruction and matches it to option D.\n\nSince both answers are the same, I will skip the subsequent steps.\n",
