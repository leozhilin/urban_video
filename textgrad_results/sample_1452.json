  "question": "Question: What objects did you observe when you descended toward the square during Movement 10?  \nOption:  \nA. I observed a street light and a tree.  \nB. I observed a fountain and a path.  \nC. I observed neighboring streets, buildings, and parasols.  \nD. I observed a bench and a garden.  \nE. I observed shops and playgrounds.  ",

  "ground_truth": "C",
  "textgrad_result": {
    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: During Movement 10, the frames show a descent towards a square where neighboring streets, buildings, and parasols are visible. The presence of parasols suggests outdoor seating areas, which are commonly found in squares or plazas. The surrounding architecture includes multiple buildings, indicating a dense urban environment. Therefore, option C accurately describes the observed objects.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:29, 0:36)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video segment from approximately 0:29 to 0:36 depicts the camera descending towards a square. During this descent, the view clearly reveals neighboring streets, numerous buildings surrounding the square, and multiple purple parasols set up in the square, likely over outdoor seating areas. These observations directly correspond to the objects listed in Option C. The provided answer's reasoning is accurate and aligns with the visual evidence presented in the video.",
