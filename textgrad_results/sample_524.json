  "question": "Question: At the initial position, you are asked to navigate to the stone statue to the right of the entrance. At the current location, if the stone statue on the right side of the entrance is not within your field of view, what is the most relevant object in your field of view, and where is this object?  \nchoose:  \nA. I see the stone statue on the right side of the entrance.  \nB. I cannot see the stone statue on the right side of the entrance, but I see a building with a right-angled facade on the right side of my field of view.  \nC. I cannot see the stone statue on the right side of the entrance, but I see the main entrance of a tall building across the street on the left side of my field of view.  \nD. I cannot see the stone statue on the right side of the entrance, but I see a bus stop in the lower right corner of my field of view.  \nE. I cannot see the stone statue on the right side of the entrance, but I see the entrance of a tall building in the center of my field of view.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The stone statue on the right side of the entrance is not within the field of view. However, the entrance of a tall building is clearly visible in the center of the field of view, which matches the description in option E.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video provides an aerial, top-down view, not a first-person perspective, which makes it challenging to directly determine the agent's \"field of view.\" However, the question explicitly states, \"if the stone statue on the right side of the entrance is not within your field of view.\" This conditional statement must be assumed true for the agent's first-person perspective, thus ruling out option A.\n\nAt the initial position (00:00-00:01), the agent is presumably at the large building's entrance or in the plaza directly in front of it. If the agent is looking outwards from this position (towards the top of the aerial frame), the most prominent features in their central field of view would be the road and the buildings across the street. The video frames (especially as the camera pans out slightly, e.g., 00:15-00:20) show several tall buildings across the street. Therefore, the \"entrance of a tall building in the center of my field of view\" (Option E) is the most plausible and relevant object if the stone statue (which is in the plaza closer to the entrance) is assumed to be out of view.\n\nThe provided answer's reasoning aligns with this interpretation, correctly assuming the \"if\" condition and identifying the most relevant object in the inferred first-person field of view.",
