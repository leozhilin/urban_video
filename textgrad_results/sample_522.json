  "question": "Question: Which takes longer, your flight to the edge of the rooftop or your descent to the street level?  \nChoices:  \nA. My flight to the edge of the rooftop takes longer than my descent to the street level.  \nB. My flight to the edge of the rooftop takes the same time as my descent to the street level.  \nC. My flight to the edge of the rooftop takes shorter than my descent to the street level.  ",
  "question_category": "Duration",
  "ground_truth": "C",
  "textgrad_result": {
    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The video frames show a rapid transition from a high vantage point overlooking the city to a closer view of the rooftop and then to street level. The descent appears to be quicker due to the perspective change, making it seem shorter in duration compared to the flight to the edge of the rooftop, which involves more gradual movement across a broader area.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 10)]\nOption: [C]\nReason: From the video, it is evident that the initial view is from a high vantage point, and the transition to the street level is rapid. The descent to street level appears quicker than the initial flight to the edge of the rooftop. Therefore, the flight to the edge of the rooftop takes shorter than the descent to the street level. The provided answer is correct.\n",
