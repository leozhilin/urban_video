    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The navigation instruction starts with \"rise, turn around, and fly to the red rockets billboard.\" To begin this sequence, the best next step is to rise and get a better view of the surroundings, which makes it easier to locate the red rockets billboard. Therefore, flying forward while rising (Option C) aligns with the initial step of the instructions.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15)]\nOption: C\nReason: The navigation instruction begins with \"rise, turn around, and fly to the red rockets billboard.\" At the initial position (0:00), the agent is at a low elevation, surrounded by trees, which obstructs the view of the city and any distant billboards. Therefore, the immediate and most crucial next step is to \"rise\" to gain a clear vantage point. Combining \"rising\" with \"flying forward\" (Option C) is a logical and efficient way to initiate the movement towards the target billboard, as it allows the agent to gain altitude and begin traversing the environment simultaneously. The video from 0:00 to 0:15 clearly shows the agent rising and moving forward, revealing the city skyline and a body of water, which supports this interpretation. The provided answer's reasoning is correct and aligns with the visual evidence and the instruction.",
