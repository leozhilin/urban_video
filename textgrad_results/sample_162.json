    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The navigation instruction starts with \"rise, turn around, and fly to the red rockets billboard.\" Given that the initial position appears to be at a lower altitude surrounded by trees, the best next step is to rise and then orient towards the target. Option C, \"I fly forward while rising,\" aligns with this need to gain altitude and move towards the specified direction.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15)]\nOption: C\nReason: The instruction is to \"rise, turn around, and fly to the red rockets billboard\". From the initial position (0-15s), the agent is surrounded by trees and at a low altitude. Therefore, the first step is to rise above the trees. Since the instruction also includes \"fly to the red rockets billboard\", the agent should fly forward while rising. Option C, \"I fly forward while rising,\" is the best next step.",
