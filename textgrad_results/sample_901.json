    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The navigation instruction starts with \"rise, turn slightly to the left, and fly to the red trees in the corner of the park.\" Given the initial position appears to be at a lower altitude near the water, the best next step is to ascend (rise) and make a slight left turn to align with the direction towards the red trees. Option D (\"I turn left and go up\") directly corresponds to this initial part of the instruction.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 11)]\nOption: D\nReason: From the initial view (0-11s), the camera is at a low altitude near the water. The instruction starts with \"rise, turn slightly to the left, and fly to the red trees in the corner of the park.\" Therefore, the best next step is to turn left and go up. Option D (\"I turn left and go up\") directly corresponds to this initial part of the instruction.\n",
