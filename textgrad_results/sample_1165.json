You move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is your best next step?  \nchoose:  \nA. I drop down and turn left.  \nB. I rise and fly forward.  \nC. I fly forward while descending.  \nD. I turn right and go up.  \nE. I rotate the camera downward.  \n````  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The agent has already flown over the blue building and turned right towards the brown building. The next step involves getting down to the white building with pillars, which suggests a descent is necessary. Therefore, flying forward while descending aligns with the next part of the navigation instruction.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:55, 2:59)]\nOption: C\nReason: The navigation instruction states, \"...turn right back and towards to the brown building. now get down to the white building with pillar...\". The video from approximately 1:55 onwards shows the agent having turned right and facing the city, with a prominent brown building in view. The immediate next part of the instruction is \"now get down to the white building with pillar\". This clearly indicates that the agent needs to descend. Given the agent is currently high above the city, flying forward while descending (Option C) is the most logical and efficient action to move towards and reach a specific building below, aligning perfectly with the instruction to \"get down to the white building\". Options A, B, D, and E do not fully or correctly capture the required movement. Option A includes \"turn left\" which is not explicitly the *next* primary movement after turning towards the brown building and before getting down to the white building. Option B and D involve rising or going up, which contradicts \"get down\". Option E is a camera action, not an agent movement.",
