    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The sequence of images shows a perspective from above the buildings, indicating that the agent is flying over them. This aligns with the navigation instruction to \"fly over the building in front of you and down to the one behind it,\" suggesting the current action is flying over buildings.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 105)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instruction states, \"take off and turn right. fly down the street to to the yellow building, stopping over the building front of it. turn right, fly over the building in front of you and down to the one behind it. turn left, flying to the stairs at the columns building.\"\n\nThe video begins with the agent at street level (0:00-0:05). From approximately 0:05 to 0:15, the agent ascends, gaining altitude and moving above the initial building. From 0:15 onwards, the perspective is clearly from above the buildings, looking down the street. The agent then turns right (around 0:15-0:20) and continues to move forward, maintaining an elevated position over the buildings and the street. This continuous movement above the buildings, as seen from 0:15 to the end of the video, directly corresponds to the instruction \"fly over the building in front of you and down to the one behind it.\" Therefore, the current action is flying over buildings. The provided answer is correct.",
