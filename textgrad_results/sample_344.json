    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The navigation instruction indicates that the agent should be approaching the final destination, which is the \"stairs at the columns building.\" Given the current perspective and the need to align with the goal, descending and flying forward would allow the agent to land or get closer to the stairs at the columns building as instructed.",
    "evaluation": "Okay, I will analyze the video and the provided answer to give my own evaluation.\n\nLocation: [(0, 2), (231, 257)]\nOption: B\nReason: The initial instruction was to fly to the stairs at the columns building. From the current vantage point on top of a building, the columns building with stairs is visible in the distance. Therefore, the best next step is to descend and fly forward to approach the destination. The video segment (0, 2) shows the initial view, and the segment (231, 257) shows the final view where the columns building with stairs is visible in the distance.\n\nThe provided answer is correct.\n",
