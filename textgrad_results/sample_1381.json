    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The current view shows that the agent is directly above the center of the helipad, as indicated by the centered \"H\" marking and the symmetrical view of the helipad's edges.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 30)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video starts with a wide shot and then zooms in progressively on the helipad. From approximately 0:01 onwards, the camera's perspective is directly overhead, looking down at the helipad. As the video progresses and zooms in further (especially from 0:10 to 0:28), the \"H\" marking and the concentric circles on the helipad remain perfectly centered in the frame, indicating that the agent's viewpoint is directly above the center of the helipad. The symmetrical view of the helipad's edges from this top-down perspective further confirms that the agent is positioned directly above its center. Therefore, the agent is currently located directly above the center of the helipad. The provided answer is correct.",
