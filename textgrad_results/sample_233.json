    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The trajectory starts from an intersection, as indicated by the presence of multiple roads and traffic lights in the initial frames. The agent then travels along the road, following the street layout shown in the subsequent frames. Finally, the agent turns towards the cafe, which is evident from the frames showing the approach to the \"CENTRAL ALL-STAR\" cafe with tables and chairs in front. This sequence matches the description in option B.",
