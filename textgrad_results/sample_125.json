    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The sequence of images shows a progression where the camera initially faces upwards towards the sky and then gradually shifts to show a distant tall building, indicating that the camera has been turned to the right to face the tall building in the distance as per the navigation instruction.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 8), (9, 15)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video starts with the camera facing upwards towards the sky. From 0 to 8 seconds, the camera gradually rotates to the right, revealing a distant tall building. From 9 to 15 seconds, the tall building becomes more prominent in the view, confirming that the camera has been turned to the right to face it. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",
