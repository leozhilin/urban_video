    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The goal is to navigate to the underground garage near the residential area consisting of gray buildings. From the current perspective, approaching the residential area entrance (Option E) is the logical next step as it will likely provide access to the underground garage within the complex. The other options do not directly lead to the residential area or the underground garage.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 119)]\nOption: E\nReason: The question asks for the next step to navigate to the underground garage near the residential area consisting of gray buildings. From the initial wide view (0:00-0:10), the prominent gray buildings are clearly visible. The video then pans and zooms in, eventually focusing on an entrance to what appears to be a residential complex (around 1:05-1:19). This entrance features a covered driveway and a gate, which is typical for accessing an underground garage within a residential area. Therefore, approaching the residential area entrance (Option E) is the most logical and high-level next step to gain access to an underground garage located within that complex. The provided answer correctly identifies this as the most appropriate action for high-level planning, as other options are either irrelevant (A), too specific and not a primary navigation target (C, D), or represent the ultimate destination rather than the immediate next approach (B).",
