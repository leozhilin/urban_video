    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The goal is to navigate to the underground garage near the residential area consisting of gray buildings. The most logical next step is to approach the residential area entrance, as it will likely provide access to the underground garage within the complex. The other options do not directly lead to the residential area or the garage.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 119)]\nOption: E\nReason: The question asks to navigate to an underground garage near the residential area consisting of gray buildings. From the initial aerial perspective (0:00-0:10), the large complex of gray residential buildings is clearly visible. To access an underground garage within or near such a complex, the most logical and high-level next step is to approach the main entrance of that residential area. The video then proceeds to zoom in on a specific entrance to this residential complex (from approximately 1:05 onwards), which appears to be a vehicle and pedestrian access point, likely leading to internal facilities including an underground garage. Options A, C, and D are either irrelevant or too specific and not the primary high-level approach. Option B, \"I approach the underground garage,\" is the ultimate destination, but the question asks what to approach *next* to *get to* the destination, implying an intermediate step if the garage itself isn't directly accessible or identifiable from the current position. Approaching the residential area entrance is the necessary precursor to finding the garage within the complex. The provided answer correctly identifies the residential area entrance as the most logical next approach.",
