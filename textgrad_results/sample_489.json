    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"take off and turn left move towards the dates car wash building.\" Since the agent is at the initial position, the best next step is to fly forward and then rise, which aligns with the take-off part of the instruction. This will allow the agent to gain altitude and prepare for the subsequent turning maneuver towards the specified building.",
