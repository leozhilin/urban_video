  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [rise from the concrete and turn right. fly over the middle of the street until you reach the buildings on the left with the short concrete wall like structure around them. turn left right beside the buildings and fly along beside them. when you get to the middle darker brown building then angle straight up and fly toward the top of the building. before you get to the top turn right and begin to level off. fly toward the building with the half pipe or half circle design on the edge of the roof. when you get to the half circle then turn left and downward and fly toward the red roof of the smaller building beside the one you climbed. stop well before you get to the roof.]. At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. What are you doing now?  \nchoose:  \nA. I fly across the middle of the street until I reach the building on the left, surrounded by a short concrete wall-like structure.  \nB. I turn right and start leveling off.  \nC. I fly straight up and towards the top of the building.  \nD. I turn left next to the building and fly along the side of the building.  \nE. I lift out of the concrete and turn right.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"lift out of the concrete and turn right,\" which is the first step in the series of movements described. The subsequent frames show the agent moving according to the instructions, starting with this initial action.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 11)]\nOption: E\nReason: The question asks what the agent is doing at the initial position, referring to the start of the video. The navigation instruction clearly states the first action is to \"rise from the concrete and turn right.\" Observing the video from 0:00, the agent begins to lift from the ground level and turn right, which is evident by the changing perspective and the street lamp moving out of view as the agent ascends and rotates. This directly corresponds to option E and the first part of the given instruction. The provided answer is correct.",
