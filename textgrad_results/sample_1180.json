    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The current position appears to be above the buildings with a clear view of the cityscape ahead. According to the navigation instruction, the next step involves moving forward over the buildings. Therefore, the best next step is to fly forward, which aligns with option E.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 109)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video begins with the agent taking off and turning towards the city (0:00-0:15). From approximately 0:15 onwards, the agent is flying forward over the buildings. The final part of the navigation instruction states: \"now move forward over the buildings and move towards the gray building at front of you and move closer to it and stay there.\" The video from 0:30 to 1:09 shows the agent continuously moving forward over the buildings, heading towards the distant cityscape. Given that the agent is currently executing the instruction to \"move forward over the buildings\" towards a specific target, the best next step is to continue flying forward to complete this segment of the instruction. The provided answer correctly identifies this.",
