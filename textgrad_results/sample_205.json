    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The video shows a first-person perspective moving through an urban environment. To navigate to the Huaji Shimo Rice Roll Rice Shop, the agent needs to turn right based on the layout of the buildings and streets visible in the frames. The parking lot is on the right side, indicating that turning right will likely lead to the desired destination.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 40)]\nOption: E\nReason: From the initial high-angle perspective (0:00-0:10), the main street where the \"Huaji Shimo Rice Roll Rice Shop\" is located runs to the right. To orient towards this street and the shop, the agent (camera) first performs a significant pan to the right (from approximately 0:10 to 0:40). This \"turn right\" action is the immediate next step shown in the video to begin navigating towards the destination, which is along the street where the parking lot is visible. The provided answer correctly identifies this initial directional change.",
