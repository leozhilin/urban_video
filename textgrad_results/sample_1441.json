    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The agent is currently at a high vantage point overlooking the ground level of high-rise buildings. To navigate to a specific store, the agent needs to get a clearer view of the ground level details. Rotating the camera downward will help in identifying the \"\u5b9d\u745e\u5802\u5927\u836f\u623f\" sign more effectively from this elevated position.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 10)]\nOption: B\nReason: At the initial position (0:00), the agent is at a high vantage point, overlooking the ground level of high-rise buildings. The task is to navigate to a store with a blue sign that reads \"\u5b9d\u745e\u5802\u5927\u836f\u623f\" on the ground level. To effectively locate and identify such a sign from an elevated position, the agent needs to get a clearer and more direct view of the ground. Rotating the camera downward, as demonstrated in the video from 0:00 to approximately 0:10, is the most logical and immediate next move to achieve this, allowing the agent to survey the ground details more effectively. The provided answer's reasoning is correct and aligns with the visual evidence and the goal.",
