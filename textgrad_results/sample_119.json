  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [take off and turn right until the edge of swimming pool and trees is on the right side view. fly forward until seeing the more buildings. turn right to seeing the big buildings. fly along the right edge of blue buildings.]. You move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I go up and turn right.  \nB. I descend and fly forward.  \nC. I fly forward while rotating the camera downward.  \nD. I turn left and go up.  \nE. I rotate the camera upward and fly forward.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current view shows that the agent is near buildings and needs to navigate forward. Descending and flying forward aligns with the instruction to \"fly forward until seeing more buildings,\" ensuring safe passage and adherence to the navigation instructions.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:53, 1:17)]\nOption: B\nReason: The agent has successfully completed the previous navigation instructions, including \"fly forward until seeing the more buildings\" (completed around 0:53) and \"turn right to seeing the big buildings\" (completed by 1:17). At 1:17, the agent is at a high altitude, looking down a street with buildings on both sides. The next instruction is \"fly along the right edge of blue buildings.\" To execute this instruction effectively, the agent must first descend to the level of the buildings and then fly forward along the street, keeping the buildings on the right. Therefore, \"I descend and fly forward\" (Option B) is the most logical and necessary next step to begin following the final instruction. The provided answer's reason incorrectly refers to a previously completed instruction (\"fly forward until seeing more buildings\"); the correct reasoning should be tied to the current, unexecuted instruction \"fly along the right edge of blue buildings.\"",
    "feedback": null,
    "final_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current view shows that the agent is near buildings and needs to navigate forward. Descending and flying forward aligns with the instruction to \"fly forward until seeing more buildings,\" ensuring safe passage and adherence to the navigation instructions."
