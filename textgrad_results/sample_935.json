  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [take off straight up into the air. halfway across the lake, turn slightly to the left and fly over the road. just before the ord intersection, turn slightly towards the last building on the right in that block. at the optician billboard, turn to the left in the direction of 10 oclock and fly forward. fly over 2 blocks of buildings then go lower to the ground in between the and and ord blocks of buildings. land on the far side of the sidewalk. turn to the left in the direction of 9 oclock. fly forward. at the first intersection, stop and look down at the ground. look up at the sky and turn to the right in the direction of 3 oclock. fly over the trees and decrease altitude until reaching the bridge. at the trees, turn to the left in the direction of 7 oclock. fly over the trees and decrease altitude at the fountain. turn to the right in the direction of 3 oclock and fly over the trees and water.]. At the initial position, you are asked to navigate according to a series of movement instructions. When you reach your current location, what is your landmark position relative to the bridge?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am on the left side of the bridge.  \nB. I am above the bridge.  \nC. I am under the bridge.  \nD. I am on the right side of the bridge.  \nE. I am far away from the bridge.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The current location, as depicted in the frames, shows a view of the city from a high vantage point with trees and water in the foreground. There is no immediate sight of the bridge, indicating that the agent is far away from it. The detailed instructions suggest that the bridge is a later destination after flying over trees and decreasing altitude at the fountain, which has not yet been reached based on the current visual context. Therefore, the agent is far away from the bridge at this point.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15), (57, 102)]\nOption: [E]\nReason: The video shows the agent flying over a city with a lake and a park. From 0:00 to 0:15, the agent is flying at a high altitude, and the bridge is not visible. From 0:57 to 1:02, the agent is still far away from the bridge. Therefore, the agent is far away from the bridge.",
