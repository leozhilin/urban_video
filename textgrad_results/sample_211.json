  "question": "Question: You are navigating to the balcony on the 13th floor. What is the correct summary of your trajectory from the beginning to the current location?  \nChoice:  \nA. I start from a high-rise building, descend to street level, and then ascend to my current location near another high-rise building.  \nB. I start from the left side of the building with a huge conical dome, turn right, and descend to a certain height.  \nC. I start from above the city, descend to a specific building, and stop at the current location.  \nD. I start from a position overlooking the city, approach a high-rise building, and then move to my current position next to the building, focusing on a specific floor.  \nE. I start from a distance, approach the target building, and then remain stationary at my current location.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The trajectory starts with a view overlooking the city, then approaches a high-rise building, and finally focuses on a specific floor (the 13th floor), which matches the description in option D.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 53)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video begins with a wide view from a high vantage point, clearly overlooking a city (0:00-0:05). The camera then moves towards and begins to descend alongside a tall, cylindrical high-rise building (0:06-0:10). As the descent continues, floor numbers become visible on the building's exterior, counting down from the top (0:11-0:48). The trajectory concludes with the camera positioned next to the 13th floor, with the number '13' clearly displayed, indicating the target floor has been reached (0:49-0:53). This sequence perfectly matches the description in Option D: starting from a position overlooking the city, approaching a high-rise building, and then moving to the current position next to the building, focusing on a specific floor (the 13th).",
