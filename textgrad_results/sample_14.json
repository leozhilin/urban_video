    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The surrounding environment includes many buildings of varying heights and a busy highway directly below, which matches the description in option E. The frames show a dense urban setting with high-rise buildings and a visible road network that appears to be a highway.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 59)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video shows the agent descending a tall building. From approximately 0:52 onwards, the floor numbers indicate the agent is at or approaching the 12th floor. At this height, the surrounding environment is clearly a dense urban area with numerous buildings of varying heights visible in the distance and closer by. Directly below the agent, a wide, multi-lane road, consistent with a highway, is prominently visible. This aligns perfectly with the description in Option E. The provided answer's reasoning accurately describes the visual evidence.",
