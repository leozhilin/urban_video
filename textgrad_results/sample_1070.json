  "question": "Question: After you turn slightly to the right to align with the building on the corner, what is your next move?  \nChoices:  \nA. Continue traveling straight over the center of the main road.  \nB. Fly over the promenade and descend slightly.  \nC. Rise to a higher altitude above the building.  \nD. Turn left, away from the building on the corner.  \nE. Hover over the street.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: After aligning with the building on the corner, the agent appears to be moving towards an open area near the water. The sequence of frames suggests a smooth transition over the promenade area, indicating that the next move is to fly over the promenade and descend slightly, as seen in the gradual approach towards the lower elevation near the water.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 45)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video shows the agent initially high above the city. From approximately 0:05 to 0:20, the agent turns slightly to the right, aligning its view with the street and buildings leading towards the coastline and the sea. After this alignment (around 0:20-0:25), the agent's next move, clearly visible from 0:25 to 0:45, is to fly forward over the promenade area adjacent to the water, while simultaneously descending to a lower altitude, getting closer to the water level. This directly matches option B. The provided answer's reasoning is accurate and consistent with the visual evidence.",
