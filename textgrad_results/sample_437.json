    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The journey begins with a view of the seaside path (as seen in the first few frames with the sea and beach visible), and it ends in a space between two buildings (as indicated by the later frames showing a narrow passage between structures).",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1), (32, 33)]\nOption: A\nReason: The video begins with a wide shot overlooking a street adjacent to a large body of water, clearly showing a \"seaside path\" or promenade (00:00-00:01). The camera then moves through a city environment, eventually descending into a very confined area. The final frames (00:32-00:33) show the perspective at ground level, looking into a very narrow passage directly between two tall buildings, which is accurately described as a \"space between two buildings\". The provided answer is consistent with this observation.",
