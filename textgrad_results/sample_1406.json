Because I was running low on power.  \nD. To align with the advertisement better.  \nE. To dodge a passing aircraft.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The agent descended slightly after moving past structures with large billboards to align with the advertisement better, as the focus seems to be on getting a clearer view of the billboard content.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 16)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video shows the agent moving forward, and around the 0:08 mark, a large billboard on a building rooftop becomes prominent. From 0:08 to 0:16, the agent clearly descends while simultaneously moving closer to the billboard. This descent brings the billboard into a more central and clearer view, allowing the text \"AMERICAN\" and \"Best way to see the USA!\" along with the image of a classic car to be easily read. The movement is a deliberate adjustment to align with and focus on the advertisement, making its content fully visible. There is no visual evidence to support options A, B, C, or E. The provided answer is correct.",
