    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"take off and turn right move towards the base bridge.\" The first few frames show an aerial view moving towards a bridge, which aligns with taking off and heading towards the base bridge as instructed. Therefore, option E correctly describes the action being taken at the initial position.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 25)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instruction explicitly states \"take off and turn right move towards the base bridge\" as the initial action. The video begins with the camera rising (taking off) from a rooftop, then turning right, and subsequently moving towards a large red bridge visible in the distance. This directly corresponds to the first part of the given instruction. Therefore, the agent is taking off and turning right towards the base bridge. The provided answer is correct.",
