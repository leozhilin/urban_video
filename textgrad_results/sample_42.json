    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"take off and turn right move towards the base bridge,\" which matches option E. The subsequent frames show a progression towards a bridge, confirming this action.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 24)]\nOption: E\nReason: The question asks what the agent is doing at the initial position according to the given instructions. The first instruction is \"take off and turn right move towards the base bridge.\" From 0:00 to approximately 0:11, the camera is static, showing the initial position. From 0:12 onwards, the camera begins to rise and pan to the right, revealing a large red suspension bridge in the distance. This visual evidence directly corresponds to the instruction \"take off and turn right move towards the base bridge.\" Therefore, option E accurately describes the agent's action at the initial stage of the video. The provided answer is correct.",
