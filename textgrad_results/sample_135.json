  "question": "Question: At the initial position, you are asked to navigate to an underground garage near a residential area consisting of gray buildings ahead. At the current location, if the underground garage near the open space is not within the field of view, what is the most relevant object in the field of view and where is this object?  \nchoose:  \nA. I can see the underground garage near the open space.  \nB. I cannot see the underground garage near the open space, but I notice a construction site with a crane in the middle right part of my field of view.  \nC. I cannot see the underground garage near the open space, but I see the open space itself in the middle of my field of view.  \nD. I cannot see the underground garage near the open space, but I observe a row of parked cars on the lower right side of my field of view.  \nE. I cannot see the underground garage near the open space, but I see a group of trees in the lower left corner of my field of view.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The underground garage near the open space is not visible in the field of view. However, there is an open space visible in the middle of the field of view, which is a significant feature in the current scene. This open space appears to be a large, undeveloped area surrounded by buildings and trees.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 19)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video shows a wide urban landscape from an elevated perspective. There are numerous residential buildings, a main road, and a large, undeveloped, somewhat barren area of land in the middle of the field of view. This undeveloped area clearly matches the description of an \"open space\". The question states that the underground garage is \"near an open space\". While the underground garage itself is not explicitly visible in the video, the open space that it is supposed to be near is very prominent and centrally located. Therefore, if the garage is not visible, the open space is the most relevant object in the field of view for orienting oneself towards the target location. Options B, D, and E describe objects that are present but are less directly relevant to the specific description of the target location (\"underground garage near an open space\") than the open space itself. The provided answer correctly identifies the open space as the most relevant object and its location.",
