  "question": "Question: At the initial position, you are asked to navigate to an underground garage near a residential area consisting of gray buildings ahead. At the current location, if the underground garage near the open space is not within the field of view, what is the most relevant object in the field of view and where is this object?  \nchoose:  \nA. I can see the underground garage near the open space.  \nB. I cannot see the underground garage near the open space, but I notice a construction site with a crane in the middle right part of my field of view.  \nC. I cannot see the underground garage near the open space, but I see the open space itself in the middle of my field of view.  \nD. I cannot see the underground garage near the open space, but I observe a row of parked cars on the lower right side of my field of view.  \nE. I cannot see the underground garage near the open space, but I see a group of trees in the lower left corner of my field of view.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The underground garage near the open space is not visible in the field of view. However, there is a construction site with a crane noticeable in the middle right part of the field of view, which stands out as a significant feature in the scene.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 19)]\nOption: B\nReason: At the initial position, the video frames do not clearly show an underground garage entrance near the open space (the large unkempt plot in the middle). However, a prominent construction site with multiple cranes is clearly visible in the middle-right to far-right background of the field of view. This construction site is a significant and distinct landmark in the urban environment, making it the most relevant object for navigation if the direct target (underground garage) is not immediately visible. The other options (open space itself, parked cars, trees) are either less specific or less unique as navigational landmarks in this context. The provided answer aligns with this analysis.",
