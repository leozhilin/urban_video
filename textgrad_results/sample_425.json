    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The frames show that the roofs of the low-rise buildings at the edge of the park have antennas installed on them. These antennas are clearly visible as they stand out against the sky and the structure of the buildings.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 59)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video frames, particularly from 00:20 onwards as the camera pans and zooms across the city skyline, clearly show several low-rise buildings at the edge of the park (across the water). On the roofs of multiple such buildings, various types of antennas are visible. For instance, a prominent antenna structure is seen on the central low-rise building from approximately 00:25 and becomes very clear as the camera moves closer and over it from 00:50 to 00:59. Other buildings in the background also appear to have similar communication equipment. While a billboard is also visible on one low-rise building (e.g., 00:35-00:45), antennas are a more common feature across multiple low-rise buildings shown. Therefore, \"An antenna\" is an accurate description of what is on the roofs of these buildings. The provided answer is correct.",
