  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [take off and turn back towards the buildings at back. now move forward over the buildings till the small white building arrives at your front and get down towards it top. now get up and turn left towards the gray tower at left and move closer it. now turn back and move forward over the buildings and get down to the top of the yellow banner at below. now get up and turn back and fly over the buildings till the white building arrives before the road. now move closer to the white building at right and get up and turn left towards the buildings at left. now move forward over the buildings and move towards the gray building at front of you and move closer to it and stay there.]. At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I fly forward and then rise.  \nB. I drop down and turn left.  \nC. I fly forward while rising.  \nD. I turn left and descend.  \nE. I rotate the camera downward.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"take off and turn back towards the buildings at back.\" This implies that the first action should be to fly forward while rising, which aligns with option C. This step is necessary to gain altitude and then reorient towards the buildings in the background as instructed.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15)]\nOption: C\nReason: The initial instruction given at the initial position is to \"take off and turn back towards the buildings at back.\" \"Take off\" implies gaining altitude. From the video's starting point at ground level (0:00), the agent immediately begins to rise, as seen by the receding ground and the changing perspective (0:00-0:15). Concurrently, there is a subtle forward movement. Therefore, \"flying forward while rising\" (Option C) accurately describes the combined action of taking off and initiating movement as the very first step. This action is essential to gain the necessary height before fully executing the \"turn back\" part of the instruction. The provided answer's reasoning aligns with this interpretation.",
