  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [take off and turn back towards the buildings at back. now move forward over the buildings till the small white building arrives at your front and get down towards it top. now get up and turn left towards the gray tower at left and move closer it. now turn back and move forward over the buildings and get down to the top of the yellow banner at below. now get up and turn back and fly over the buildings till the white building arrives before the road. now move closer to the white building at right and get up and turn left towards the buildings at left. now move forward over the buildings and move towards the gray building at front of you and move closer to it and stay there.]. At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I fly forward and then rise.  \nB. I drop down and turn left.  \nC. I fly forward while rising.  \nD. I turn left and descend.  \nE. I rotate the camera downward.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"take off and turn back towards the buildings at back.\" This implies that the first action should be to fly forward while rising, which aligns with option C. This step is necessary to gain altitude and then reorient towards the buildings as instructed.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15)]\nOption: C\nReason: The initial navigation instruction is to \"take off and turn back towards the buildings at back.\" The very first action required is \"take off,\" which means to gain altitude from the initial ground-level position. Option C, \"I fly forward while rising,\" is the most fitting description of initiating flight or \"taking off\" among the given choices, as it combines upward movement (rising) with a general forward motion to become airborne. While the instruction also includes \"turn back towards the buildings at back,\" the \"take off\" is the immediate prerequisite to any further movement or reorientation. The video from 0:00 to 0:08 clearly shows the agent rising. The provided answer's reasoning correctly identifies that gaining altitude is necessary, but its statement that \"fly forward while rising\" directly aligns with \"turn back towards the buildings at back\" is imprecise, as \"fly forward\" in the initial orientation would be in the wrong direction. However, interpreting \"fly forward while rising\" as the general action of \"taking off\" makes Option C the best choice for the immediate next step.",
