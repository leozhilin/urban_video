    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The parking lot across the street is a logical next step as it likely provides access to the underground garage near the residential area consisting of gray buildings ahead. Approaching the parking lot can lead to an entrance for the underground facility.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 19)]\nOption: D\nReason: The question asks to navigate to an underground garage near a residential area consisting of gray buildings ahead. From the initial position (0-19s), the parking lot across the street is the most logical next step. It's reasonable to assume that an underground garage entrance might be located within or accessible from the parking lot. The other options are less likely to lead to an underground garage. Approaching the construction crane, the center of the clearing, the streetlight, or the highest point of the building on the left doesn't directly suggest a path to an underground parking facility. The provided answer is correct.\n",
