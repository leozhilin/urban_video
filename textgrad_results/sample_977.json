  "question": "Question: At the initial position, you are asked to navigate to a purple ledge on the approximate mid-level of the building directly below you at the beginning. At your current location, if the purple window sill approximately in the middle is not in your field of view, what is the most relevant object in your field of view, and where is it?  \nchoose:  \nA. I cannot see the purple window sill on the middle floor, but there is a small green space in the lower right corner.  \nB. I cannot see the purple window sill on the middle floor, but there is a large beige building on the left.  \nC. I cannot see the purple window sill approximately mid-level, but I can see a building-like main entrance in the lower-middle part of the view.  \nD. The purple window sill about mid-level is already in view.  \nE. I cannot see the purple window sills on the near mid-level, but I can see the top of another high-rise building in the distant background.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The initial frames show a top-down view of a building complex. At the beginning, the purple window sill is not visible, but there is a clear view of a building-like main entrance in the lower-middle part of the view, which is a prominent feature in the field of view.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1)]\nOption: C\nReason: At the initial position (00:00-00:01), the view is a top-down perspective of a building complex. The question states that the purple window sill is not in the field of view, which is consistent with the visual evidence as no purple features are visible. The most prominent and relevant object in the field of view, particularly on the building directly below the agent, is a distinct building-like main entrance located in the lower-middle part of the view. This feature is clearly visible and serves as a significant landmark. The provided answer aligns with this observation.",
