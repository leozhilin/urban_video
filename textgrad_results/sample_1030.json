  "question": "Question: You are flying towards the outer edge of the residential area and have made a half-circle. What is the correct summary of your trajectory from the beginning to your current position?  \nChoice:  \nA. I start from above the swimming pool, move towards the high-rise building, and make a half-circle around the residential area.  \nB. I start from the park, fly over high-rise buildings, and circle half a circle around the residential area.  \nC. I start from the street, fly over the park, and make a half-circle around the residential area.  \nD. I start from above the swimming pool, rise to a higher altitude, make a half-circle, and move to the edge of the residential area.  \nE. I start from the playground, fly towards the high-rise building, and then make a half-circle around the residential area.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The trajectory starts from above the swimming pool, as seen in the initial frames. The agent then rises to a higher altitude, providing a broader view of the residential area. Finally, the agent makes a half-circle around the residential area, moving towards the outer edge, which is evident from the changing perspective and the visible surroundings in the later frames.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 39)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video begins with an overhead view directly above a swimming pool (0:00-0:08), confirming the starting point. From approximately 0:08 onwards, the camera clearly gains altitude, providing an increasingly broader view of the residential area, including high-rise buildings and green spaces. The agent then performs a continuous arcing or panning motion (0:10-0:39), which constitutes a half-circle around the residential complex. By the end of the video (0:30-0:39), the view reveals a river/canal and a main road, indicating that the agent has moved towards and is now positioned at the outer edge of the residential area, consistent with the question's description. Therefore, Option D accurately summarizes the trajectory. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with this analysis.",
