  "question": "Question: How do you correctly summarize your trajectory from the beginning to the current location as you fly towards a two-story house with a blue tile roof in the community?  \nChoice:  \nA. Start from a high-rise building, descend to street level, and move towards the park.  \nB. Start from the center of the park, move toward the street, and then turn right to reach the small house.  \nC. Start from above a high-rise building, descend to street level, and then move toward a small house.  \nD. Start from the air on the left side of the high-rise building, translate to the left in the horizontal direction, fly forward, align with the roof of the small house, and descend towards the target small house.  \nE. Start from the walking path in the park, turn left to face the street outside the park, rise to the height of the rooftop of the high-rise building across the street, and move forward to the roof of the high-rise building at your current location outside the edge.

    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The trajectory starts from the air on the left side of a high-rise building, moves horizontally to the left, flies forward, aligns with the roof of a small house, and then descends towards the target small house, which matches the visual progression in the frames provided.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 27)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video begins with the agent's perspective from a high altitude, specifically from the air on the left side of a prominent high-rise building (00:00). From approximately 00:00 to 00:10, the agent performs a clear horizontal translation to the left, moving away from the initial high-rise. Following this, from 00:11 onwards, the agent begins to fly forward into the community, gradually aligning its view with a small house that has a blue tile roof, which becomes increasingly central in the frame. Finally, from around 00:20 to 00:27, the agent clearly descends towards this target small house, getting closer to ground level. This sequence of movements\u2014starting high and left of a building, translating horizontally left, flying forward, aligning, and then descending to the target house\u2014is precisely described by Option D. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with this observation.",
