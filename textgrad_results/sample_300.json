  "question": "Question: At the initial position, you are asked to navigate to the purple window sill at approximately the middle level of the building directly below you at the beginning. When you reach your current location, what is the direction to the destination?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am currently located above the building on the purple ledge, above the roof.  \nB. I am currently located on the right side of the target building, but significantly higher than the middle floor.  \nC. I am currently located on the left side of the target building, and my height is much lower than the middle floor.  \nD. I am currently located directly above the building, but at a significantly higher height than the middle floor.  \nE. I am currently located directly above the target building, approximately at the same height as the mid-rise.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The agent is currently positioned directly above the target building but at a significantly higher height than the middle floor, as indicated by the top-down view showing the entire roof structure of the building below.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 3)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video shows the agent (a small drone-like object) hovering directly above the roof of a large building. The initial view at 00:00 shows the agent high above the building, and the subsequent frames (00:01-00:03) zoom into a top-down perspective, confirming the agent's position directly over the building's roof. The destination is described as a \"purple window sill at approximately the middle level of the building.\" Since the agent is above the roof, it is clearly at a significantly higher elevation than any middle floor. Therefore, the agent is \"directly above the building, but at a significantly higher height than the middle floor.\" The provided answer correctly identifies Option D and provides a consistent reason.",
