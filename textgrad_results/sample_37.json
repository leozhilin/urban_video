    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The agent veered slightly to the left to adjust its path away from the road, which is a common maneuver to avoid potential obstacles or to navigate more effectively within the urban environment depicted in the images.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 27)]\nOption: A\nReason: The video shows the agent moving along a street lined with buildings. The agent veers slightly to the left, away from the center of the road and towards the buildings on the left. This movement aligns with the idea of adjusting the path away from the road, possibly to avoid obstacles or navigate more effectively within the urban environment. There is no evidence of air traffic, wind interference, a specific destination being focused on, or altitude instability. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation. The provided answer is correct.\n",
