  "question": "Question: Why did you veer slightly to the left, facing the row of buildings along the street?  \nChoices:  \nA. To adjust your path away from the road.  \nB. To avoid air traffic above the intersection.  \nC. Due to wind interference.  \nD. To focus on your destination.  \nE. To maintain altitude stability.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The agent veered slightly to the left to adjust its path away from the road, which is a common maneuver to avoid potential obstacles or to align with a safer or more efficient route along the row of buildings. This action suggests an intention to navigate closer to the structures, possibly for cover, a clearer path, or as part of a planned route.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 27)]\nOption: A\nReason: The video shows the agent initially moving down the center of the street. From approximately 0:10 onwards, the agent gradually shifts its trajectory to the left, moving closer to the row of buildings on the left side of the street. By 0:15, the agent is clearly positioned alongside these buildings, no longer centered on the road. This movement is a clear adjustment of its path, moving away from the central road space and closer to the structures. There is no visual evidence to support avoiding air traffic, wind interference, or issues with altitude stability. While the buildings might be a destination, the action itself is a path adjustment. The provided answer correctly identifies this as an adjustment away from the road, aligning with the visual evidence of the agent moving from the center of the street towards the side where the buildings are.",
