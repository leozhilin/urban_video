  "question": "Question: Why did you veer slightly to the left, facing the row of buildings along the street?  \nChoices:  \nA. To adjust your path away from the road.  \nB. To avoid air traffic above the intersection.  \nC. Due to wind interference.  \nD. To focus on your destination.  \nE. To maintain altitude stability.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The agent veered slightly to the left to adjust its path away from the road, which is a common maneuver to avoid potential obstacles or to align better with the intended route along the row of buildings. This action helps in navigating more safely and efficiently within the urban environment.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 27)]\nOption: A\nReason: The video shows the agent initially moving down the center of the street (approximately 0:00-0:10). From around 0:10, the agent begins a gradual leftward movement, shifting its trajectory to fly closer to the row of buildings on the left side of the street. By 0:17 and onwards, the agent is clearly positioned alongside these buildings, indicating a deliberate adjustment of its path from the main thoroughfare to a route adjacent to the structures. This maneuver aligns with adjusting the path away from the central road to follow the building line, likely as part of a planned route or to navigate the urban environment more closely to the structures. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with this observation.",
