At your current location, if the main entrance is not within view, what is the most relevant object in view? Where is the object?  \nchoose:  \nA. The main entrance is not visible in my field of view, but there is a park in the lower left corner of my field of view.  \nB. The main entrance is not visible, but there is a small building in the upper right corner of my field of view.  \nC. The main entrance is not visible in my field of view, but there is a big tree in the center of my field of view.  \nD. The main entrance cannot be seen, but there is the main entrance of a tall building across the street on the left side of my field of view.  \nE. The main entrance is within my field of view.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The main entrance is not visible in the current field of view, but there is a small building noticeable in the upper right corner of the image. This small building stands out as the most relevant object given the options provided.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 5)]\nOption: B\nReason: At the initial position (0:00-0:05), the video presents an aerial view of a building complex. From this high-level perspective, a specific \"main entrance\" is not clearly discernible. Therefore, the condition \"if the main entrance is not within view\" is met. Among the objects that become visible as the camera descends and the view becomes more detailed (starting around 0:02), a distinct small building with a blue roof appears on the right side of the screen. While the option describes its location as \"upper right corner,\" it is more accurately situated in the mid-right to lower-right portion of the field of view during these initial frames. Despite this minor inaccuracy in the location description, this small building is the most relevant and distinct object mentioned in the options that is present in the initial view, making Option B the most plausible choice. Other options like a park in the lower left or a big tree in the center are not visible in the initial frames. The provided answer correctly identifies Option B and its reasoning aligns with the presence of this small building as a relevant object.",
