    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The main entrance is not visible in the current field of view, but there is a small building noticeable in the upper right corner of the image. This small building stands out as a distinct object in the scene compared to other elements like trees or open spaces.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 2)]\nOption: [A]\nReason: At the initial position (0-2s), the main entrance is not visible. However, there is a park visible in the lower left corner of the field of view. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate answer. The provided answer is incorrect because there is no small building in the upper right corner.",
    "feedback": "### 1. Key Disagreements\n\n#### 1.1 Visibility of the Main Entrance\n- **Original Answer Viewpoint**: The main entrance is not visible in the current field of view.\n- **Evaluation Viewpoint**: The main entrance is not visible in the current field of view (agreement on this point).\n\n#### 1.2 Most Relevant Object in View\n- **Original Answer Viewpoint**: The most relevant object is a small building in the upper right corner of the field of view.\n- **Evaluation Viewpoint**: The most relevant object is a park in the lower left corner of the field of view.\n\n#### 1.3 Location of the Object\n- **Original Answer Viewpoint**: The small building is located in the upper right corner.\n- **Evaluation Viewpoint**: The park is located in the lower left corner.\n\n### 2. Required Verifications\n\n#### 2.1 Verification of the Presence of a Small Building\n- **Specific Visual Evidence Needed**: A clear image or frame showing the upper right corner of the field of view to confirm the presence or absence of a small building.\n- **Additional Frames or Perspectives**: A close-up or zoomed-in view of the upper right corner would help resolve this disagreement.\n- **Kind of Visual Information**: High-resolution imagery or video frames that clearly depict the upper right corner.\n\n#### 2.2 Verification of the Presence of a Park\n- **Specific Visual Evidence Needed**: A clear image or frame showing the lower left corner of the field of view to confirm the presence or absence of a park.\n- **Additional Frames or Perspectives**: A close-up or zoomed-in view of the lower left corner would help resolve this disagreement.\n- **Kind of Visual Information**: High-resolution imagery or video frames that clearly depict the lower left corner.\n\n### 3. Resolution Path\n\n#### 3.1 Steps to Resolve the Disagreement on the Small Building\n1. **Examine the Upper Right Corner**: Review high-resolution images or video frames focusing on the upper right corner to determine if a small building is present.\n2. **Compare with Known Features**: Compare the observed features with known characteristics of a small building (e.g., structure, size, and shape).\n3. **Consult Additional Sources**: If available, consult other sources or perspectives that might provide additional context about the upper right corner.\n\n#### 3.2 Steps to Resolve the Disagreement on the Park\n1. **Examine the Lower Left Corner**: Review high-resolution images or video frames focusing on the lower left corner to determine if a park is present.\n2. **Identify Park Features**: Look for features typically associated with a park, such as greenery, pathways, benches, etc.\n3. **Consult Additional Sources**: If available, consult other sources or perspectives that might provide additional context about the lower left corner.\n\n#### 3.3 Prioritization of Verifications\n- **Priority 1**: Verify the presence of the park in the lower left corner. This is prioritized because the evaluation explicitly states the presence of a park, which could be a critical piece of information for navigation.\n- **Priority 2**: Verify the presence of the small building in the upper right corner. This is secondary but still important for a comprehensive understanding of the scene.\n\n#### 3.4 Additional Evidence Needed\n- **High-Resolution Imagery**: Clear, high-resolution images or video frames of both the upper right and lower left corners.\n- **Contextual Information**: Any additional contextual information about the location, such as maps or descriptions of the area.\n\nBy following these steps and gathering the necessary visual evidence, the key disagreements can be resolved, and a more accurate understanding of the scene can be achieved.",
    "final_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The main entrance is not visible in the current field of view, but there is a park noticeable in the lower left corner of the image. This park is a distinct and relevant feature in the scene compared to other elements."
