What are your next steps?  \nchoose:  \nA. I rise and rotate the camera upward.  \nB. I descend and rotate the camera upward.  \nC. I fly forward.  \nD. I turn left.  \nE. I rotate around.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: To navigate to the open space to the right of the \"Mr. Fan\" shop in the residential area, the most direct action is to fly forward. This will allow the agent to cover the distance efficiently and reach the target location without unnecessary maneuvers.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 42)]\nOption: C\nReason: From the initial high-altitude perspective at 0:00, the target \"open space to the right of the 'Mr. Fan' shop in the residential area below\" is located on the ground level. To reach this area, the agent must move downwards and towards the buildings. The video demonstrates this by showing the camera continuously moving forward and descending from 0:00 to approximately 0:38, getting closer to the residential area and eventually revealing the shop fronts, including \"Mr. Fan\" at 0:41. Therefore, \"fly forward\" is the most appropriate and encompassing initial action to navigate from the high starting point towards the target location on the ground. Options A, B, D, and E are either counterproductive (rising, rotating camera upward) or insufficient (turning left, rotating around) for reaching the target area from the initial position. The provided answer correctly identifies \"fly forward\" as the most direct and efficient next step.",
