    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The sequence of images shows the agent moving towards and then over a bridge, aligning with the instruction to \"fly in to the road presented in the bridge.\" The final frames depict a view from the bridge looking towards the city, indicating that the agent has successfully navigated onto the road over the bridge.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(2, 47), (224, 247)]\nOption: D\nReason: The navigation instruction states, \"after reaching the top of the building turn left and fly straight to the river and fly at the right side of the building and cross the first checkpoint and fly in to the road presented in the bridge.\" The video shows the agent flying upwards and reaching the top of a tall building around the 0:50 mark. Subsequently, the agent flies towards the river (visible from approximately 1:20) and then proceeds towards a bridge. From 2:24 onwards, the agent is clearly positioned on the road of the bridge, looking across the water towards the opposite side of the city. This directly corresponds to the instruction \"fly in to the road presented in the bridge.\" The provided answer correctly identifies this action as the current state of the agent's movement.",
