  "question": "Question: Why do you veer slightly to the left after taking off over a building?  \nChoices: A. To avoid tall structures in your path.  \n           B. I turn left, keeping my direction in line with the street, for a smoother approach.  \n           C. I turned left due to an unexpected loss of altitude.  \n           D. To land on another roof.  \n           E. Sudden strong wind affects my stability, causing me to turn left.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The agent veers slightly to the left after taking off over a building to align its direction with the street, which provides a smoother and more controlled approach towards the next destination or landing spot. This maneuver helps in maintaining a steady path and avoiding any abrupt changes in direction that could be caused by other factors like wind or obstacles.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 30)]\nOption: B\nReason: After ascending and gaining significant altitude over the park (around 0:20-0:25), the agent smoothly veers slightly to the left, starting around 0:25. This turn aligns the agent's flight path with the long, straight street and the adjacent body of water visible on the right side of the screen. This alignment provides a clear and unobstructed corridor for continued flight, indicating a deliberate maneuver for a smoother and more controlled approach along the city's existing layout. There is no visual evidence of sudden altitude loss, strong winds, or immediate obstacles necessitating an avoidance maneuver. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with this observation.",
