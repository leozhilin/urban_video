    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The navigation instructions lead to a position where the agent is on the right side of the tall building at the corner by the water, as indicated by the final steps involving turning right towards the water and then left to follow the path next to the building. The images confirm this positioning as the agent appears to be moving alongside the building from its right side.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:20, 0:40)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video segment from 0:20 to 0:40 clearly shows the agent moving along a street. During this movement, the tall building on the corner by the water is consistently visible on the agent's left side, while the water is on the agent's right side. If the tall building is on the agent's left, it means the agent is located on the right side of that building. This visual evidence directly supports the agent's position relative to the landmark. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with this observation.",
