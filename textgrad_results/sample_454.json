    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The journey begins with a view from a tall skyscraper, as indicated by the high vantage point overlooking the city skyline in the initial frames. As the sequence progresses, the perspective shifts downward and forward, eventually stabilizing above a body of water surrounded by greenery, which matches the description of a lakeside area. This transition from a high urban starting point to a stable position over water aligns with option C.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 4), (138, 142)]\nOption: [C]\nReason: The video starts with a high-altitude view of the city, showing the tops of skyscrapers and a park with a lake. The video ends with a stable view above the water in a lakeside area. Therefore, the starting point is a tall skyscraper with its roof visible, and the ending point is a stable position above the water in a lakeside area.",
