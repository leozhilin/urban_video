What is your next move, given the target location for your next move?  \nchoose:  \nA. I rise.  \nB. I rotate the camera downward.  \nC. I fly forward.  \nD. I turn left.  \nE. I turn right.  \nF. I rotate the camera upward.  \nG. I have reached the destination, no more movements are needed.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: Given the task to navigate to an electric door next to you with a transformer box beside it, and considering the provided frames show a first-person perspective moving through a structured environment, the logical next move would be to turn right. The frames suggest that the agent is currently facing a building or wall, and turning right might reveal the side where the electric door and transformer box are located. This action aligns with typical navigation strategies in such environments.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(01:29, 01:30)]\nOption: E\nReason: At approximately 01:29, the video shows a first-person perspective moving forward along a sidewalk. The question states that the agent needs to navigate to an electric door with a transformer box next to it, and these are \"next to you\" at the initial position. Immediately following 01:29, at 01:30, the camera rapidly rotates to the right, revealing a gate (which can be interpreted as an electric door) and a black box (a transformer box) directly to the right of the agent's previous forward path. This visual evidence confirms that the target location was to the agent's right. Therefore, the next logical move to face or approach this target from the position at 01:29 would be to turn right. The provided answer correctly identifies this action.",
