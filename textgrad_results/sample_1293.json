  "question": "Question: Starting from the starting position, you are required to navigate to an underground garage near a residential area consisting of gray buildings in front of you. How would you correctly summarize your trajectory from the starting position to the current position?  \nChoice:  \nA. Start from the parking lot, fly towards the main road, and then fly over a group of residential buildings to reach your current location.  \nB. Start from above the residential building, descend to street level, and move along the road to your current location.  \nC. Start from a high altitude above the city, gradually descend, move to the open space, and end your trajectory at the current location.  \nD. Start from above the street, turn right, fly forward over the street, move towards the residential group, and reach your current location.  \nE. Start from the position above the parking lot, fly towards the main road, fly over the road, fly towards the residential group, and reach your current location.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The trajectory described in option E matches the visual sequence of the frames. Starting from a position above the parking lot, the agent flies towards the main road, then over the road, and finally towards the residential group, which is consistent with the progression of scenes in the images provided.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 19)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video begins with an aerial view positioned above what appears to be a parking lot or a commercial area adjacent to a main road (0:00-0:01). As the video progresses, the camera pans and moves, showing the agent flying towards and along the main road (0:01-0:10). The perspective remains aerial, indicating the agent is flying over the road and the surrounding area. Finally, the trajectory clearly leads towards the large group of residential buildings visible across the road, which aligns with the question's goal of navigating to an underground garage near a residential area (0:10-0:19). Option E accurately summarizes this sequence of movements: starting above a parking lot, moving towards the main road, flying over the road, and heading towards the residential group. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with this visual evidence.",
