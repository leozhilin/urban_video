The video begins with the agent at the initial position (0:00-0:06) and then shows the agent taking off, turning slightly to the right, and moving forward (0:07 onwards). Therefore, the best next step, as per the instruction and observed initial movement, is to turn right and fly forward. The provided answer correctly identifies this.",
