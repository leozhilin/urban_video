    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The flight path starts from above the red brick path in the courtyard, moves forward along the edge of the pond, reaches the top of the pavilion by the pond, provides a view of the path, trees, pond, and pavilion by the water, and finally descends to the roof of the pavilion. This matches the sequence of images showing an aerial view starting from a broader area and gradually focusing on the roof of the pavilion next to the pond.",
