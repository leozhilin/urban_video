  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [Raise the altitude, fly over the opposite road, and fly in the direction of the mountains]. You move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is your best next step?  \nchoose:  \nA. I rise and then fly forward.  \nB. I descend and turn left.  \nC. I fly forward and rotate the camera upward.  \nD. I turn right and descend.  \nE. I turn right and fly forward.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The navigation instruction is to \"Raise the altitude, fly over the opposite road, and fly in the direction of the mountains.\" Given the current position and the need to follow this instruction, the best next step is to rise and then fly forward. This will help in gaining the necessary altitude to safely fly over the road and continue towards the mountains.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 5)]\nOption: A\nReason: The navigation instruction explicitly states to \"Raise the altitude\" as the first step. From the initial position shown at 0:00, the agent is at a relatively low altitude, surrounded by buildings. To effectively \"fly over the opposite road, and fly in the direction of the mountains,\" gaining altitude is a prerequisite to clear the immediate obstacles and get a clear path. Therefore, \"I rise\" is the most appropriate and immediate next step. Following this, \"and then fly forward\" is a logical progression towards the stated destination. The video itself demonstrates the agent rising in the initial frames (0:00-0:20), which aligns with this interpretation. The provided answer correctly identifies the best next step.",
