  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [go straight and move to the top of the view. take slowly left and turn around the top of the building. near by the building and in front of advertisements on the board. go straight and move to the bridge and turn right into the building. more than the advertisements in the building. go straight and move to cross the lake and nearby the building blocks. turn around the building and turn right to the top of the view. move upwards and turn around the building.]. At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. When you reach the current location, what is your landmark position relative to the bridge?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am on the left side of the bridge.  \nB. I am far away from the bridge.  \nC. I am located above the bridge.  \nD. I am located on the right side of the bridge.  \nE. I am under the bridge.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The navigation instructions indicate moving to the top of the view and crossing a bridge, followed by turning around a building and moving upwards again. The current location appears to be elevated, suggesting that the agent is above the bridge. Therefore, the landmark position relative to the bridge is that the agent is located above it.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(2, 4), (2:20, 2:40), (3:07, 3:50)]\nOption: C\nReason: The navigation instructions guide the agent to move \"to the top of the view\" and later \"move upwards and turn around the building,\" indicating a significant increase in elevation. At the current location (the end of the video), the agent is positioned high above the city, looking down at a large body of water and a bridge spanning it (visible from approximately 2:20 onwards, and clearly from 3:07 to 3:50). This elevated perspective confirms that the agent is located above the bridge. The provided answer correctly identifies this relationship based on the visual evidence and the cumulative effect of the navigation instructions.",
