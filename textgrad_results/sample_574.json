    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current location, as described by the navigation instructions and visual frames, indicates that the agent has moved away from the pond next to the trees. The agent is now on top of a building, which means they are not near the pond or trees anymore. Therefore, the correct answer is that the agent stays away from the pond next to the woods.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(03:10, 03:40), (04:50, 05:10)]\nOption: B\nReason: The navigation instructions state that the agent first goes \"over the building and road and beside trees and pond\" (visible around 03:10-03:40, where the agent is flying above a park with a pond and trees). Following this, the instructions direct the agent to \"turn back and move forward and turn right at white building and little move forward and turn left and move towards the top of the next white building and go over the building. now move forward and next building top and turn left and get down and stay there.\" The video frames from 04:50 to 05:10 show the agent's final position on top of a building, looking out over the city. From this vantage point, the pond and trees are visible in the distance, but the agent is clearly not located next to them or directly above them. The agent has moved significantly into the city and is now on a rooftop, indicating a considerable distance from the pond and trees. Therefore, the agent is \"away from the pond next to the woods.\" The provided answer is correct.",
