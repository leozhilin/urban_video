    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: As the agent moves forward, it passes by two prominent towers and a bridge is clearly visible in the foreground. Additionally, there are two bodies of water on either side of the bridge, which aligns with the description in option C.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 14)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video starts with the agent on a bridge, with two prominent towers visible in the distance. As the agent moves forward on the bridge (from 0:00 to approximately 0:14), the bridge itself is clearly in the foreground, and two distinct bodies of water are visible on either side of the bridge, extending towards the city where the towers are located. This directly corresponds to observing a bridge and two bodies of water as the agent passes by the two towers. The provided answer is correct.",
