At the initial position, you are asked to navigate according to a series of movement instructions. What is the Landmark Position from the pond when you reach the current location?  \nchoose:  \nA.

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The current location, as indicated by the final frames, is far from the pond. The agent has moved past the pond and is now at a distant location overlooking the sea, which means the pond is no longer in close proximity.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 3), (17, 32), (315, 350)]\nOption: [E]\nReason: The navigation instructions lead the agent to a location far from the pond. The video shows the agent moving towards the base bridge, then the red rocket building, and finally the pond. After passing the pond, the agent continues to move forward and slows down to the road. The final frames of the video show the agent at a distant location overlooking the sea, indicating that the pond is no longer in close proximity. Therefore, the landmark position from the pond when the agent reaches the current location is far away from the pond.",
