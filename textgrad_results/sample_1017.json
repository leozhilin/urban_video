    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current location, as depicted in the frames, shows a distant view of the cityscape with no immediate proximity to the Coca-Cola billboard. The agent appears to be at a high vantage point overlooking the city, indicating that they are far away from the specific landmark mentioned.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:50, 1:51)]\nOption: B\nReason: The agent is located on the \"stone building with the coca cola bottle billboard\" from approximately 0:50 to 1:00. Following this, the navigation instructions require the agent to \"turn to the right and fly to the daves car wash billboard,\" and then \"turn to the left and fly to the last building on the street that has a door on the roof.\" The video shows the agent flying continuously from 1:00 to 1:45, covering a significant distance over multiple city blocks. The final view at 1:51 is a wide cityscape from a high vantage point, indicating that the agent has traveled a considerable distance from the location of the Coca-Cola billboard. Therefore, the agent is far away from the Coca-Cola billboard at the current location. The provided answer's reasoning is correct as it highlights the distant view and the agent's high vantage point, which are direct consequences of the extensive flight path.",
