    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The trajectory starts from a park-like area (as seen in the initial frames with greenery and open space), moves towards the street, then ascends to the 10th floor of a high-rise building, and finally approaches the balcony, which matches the description in option C.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 46)]\nOption: [C]\nReason: The video starts with a wide view showing the building surrounded by greenery and roads, which can be considered a park-like area. The camera then moves closer to the building, ascending to the 10th floor (as indicated by the floor numbers on the building's exterior), and finally focuses on the balcony. This trajectory matches the description in option C: \"I start from the park, move toward the street, rise to the 10th floor, and approach the balcony.\"\n",
