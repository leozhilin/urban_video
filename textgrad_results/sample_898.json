    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The agent has already flown towards the top of the brown tower and turned right to move near the pond. The next step according to the instructions is to slow down to the floor, which means descending while moving forward towards the mid-center of the pond behind the tree. Therefore, flying forward while descending aligns with the next steps in the navigation instruction.",
