You move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I turn left and go up.  \nB. I descend and then fly forward.  \nC. I fly forward while rising.  \nD. I turn right and descend.  \nE. I rotate the camera downward.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The navigation instruction suggests moving forward and going over buildings, which implies that the next step should involve flying forward while rising to navigate over obstacles like buildings. This aligns with option C, \"I fly forward while rising.\"",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:40, 2:05)]\nOption: C\nReason: At approximately 1:40 in the video, the agent is positioned at street level. Based on the provided navigation instructions, the agent would have just completed a \"get down at intersection road\" command. The immediate subsequent instruction is \"turn right at tree and fly up and move forward.\" From 1:40 onwards, the video clearly shows the agent beginning to ascend and move forward, gaining altitude over the city buildings. This action directly corresponds to \"fly up and move forward,\" which is accurately described by \"I fly forward while rising.\" The provided answer's reasoning that \"moving forward and going over buildings, which implies that the next step should involve flying forward while rising\" is consistent with the visual evidence and the navigation instructions.",
