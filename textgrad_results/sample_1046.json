    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: Moving backward from the starting position allows the agent to capture a wider view of the surrounding area, including the buildings, trees, and the track field, providing a broader perspective of the environment.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15)]\nOption: D\nReason: At the beginning of the video, the camera is very close to the facade of a building, showing only a limited portion of it. As the agent moves backward from approximately 0:01 to 0:15, the field of view progressively widens, revealing more of the building, the parking lot below, other buildings in the distance, and the surrounding landscape including trees and a track field. This movement clearly serves the purpose of capturing a broader and more comprehensive view of the environment. The provided answer correctly identifies this reason.",
