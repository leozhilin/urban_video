At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I fly forward, then turn left.  \nB. I drop down and turn right.  \nC. I fly forward while rising.  \nD. I turn left and descend.  \nE. I rotate the camera upward and fly forward.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"zoom in on the left tower,\" which suggests that the agent should focus on getting a closer view of the tower. Rotating the camera upward and flying forward (option E) aligns with this requirement as it would allow the agent to approach and focus on the tower effectively. The other options do not directly address the need to zoom in on the tower.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 25)]\nOption: E\nReason: The first instruction is to \"zoom in on the left tower.\" At the initial position (0:00-0:14), the agent is on a bridge looking towards the city with two prominent towers. To \"zoom in\" on the left tower, the agent needs to move closer to it (fly forward) and likely adjust its vertical view to properly frame the tall structure (rotate the camera upward). Starting from approximately 0:14, the video shows the agent moving forward and gradually rising, with the camera tilting upwards to focus on the left tower, effectively \"zooming in\" on it. Option E, \"I rotate the camera upward and fly forward,\" accurately describes the necessary actions to fulfill the instruction. The other options do not fully or correctly address the \"zoom in\" instruction for a tall object like a tower.",
