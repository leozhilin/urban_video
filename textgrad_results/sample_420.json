    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"zoom in on the left tower,\" which suggests that the agent should focus on getting a closer view of the tower. Rotating the camera upward and flying forward (option E) aligns with this requirement as it allows for an elevated perspective and approach towards the tower, facilitating a zoom-in action. Other options do not directly address the need to focus on the left tower immediately.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15)]\nOption: E\nReason: From the initial position (0-15s), the left tower is in front of the agent. To zoom in on the left tower, the agent needs to rotate the camera upward and fly forward. Therefore, the best next step is to rotate the camera upward and fly forward.",
