    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current location is directly above the elevator, which is to the left of the entrance, as indicated by the perspective and layout of the building in the images.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 159)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video begins with a high-altitude view of a city, showing a tall, rectangular building on the left and a rounder building to its right. As the video progresses, the camera descends and pans, focusing on the round building. From approximately 0:09 onwards, and especially in the latter half of the video (e.g., 1:40-1:59), the camera is positioned high above the ground level, looking directly down at the entrance area of the round building. The question asks for the direction to \"the elevator on the left side of the entrance.\" The camera's current perspective is from directly above this entrance area, and its horizontal alignment appears to be over the left side of the entrance, consistent with being \"directly above the elevator, to the left of the entrance.\" Therefore, from this current location, the destination is directly below.",
