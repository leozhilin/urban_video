    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The provided frames show an aerial view of a building and its surroundings, but the perspective is from above rather than a first-person view. Additionally, the images do not depict a first-person navigation scenario where the roof of a three-story building ahead would be within sight at the initial position. Therefore, based on the given context and the nature of the images, the destination (roof of a three-story building) is not visible in the current field of view from this aerial perspective.",
