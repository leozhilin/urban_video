    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The initial instruction starts with \"take off and move forward,\" and the images show a view from a high vantage point, suggesting that the agent is preparing to or has just taken off. Therefore, the current action aligns with taking off and flying forward.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15)]\nOption: C\nReason: The navigation instruction begins with \"take off and move forward\". The video starts with a view from a high vantage point (likely a rooftop or balcony), and then the camera smoothly moves upwards and forward, revealing a wider aerial view of the park and city. This visual progression directly corresponds to the action of taking off and moving forward, as stated in the initial part of the instruction. Therefore, the agent is currently taking off and flying forward. The provided answer is correct.",
