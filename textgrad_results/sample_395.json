    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The sequence of images shows the agent starting at ground level between buildings and gradually ascending to a higher vantage point above the buildings, indicating that the agent is flying over buildings as part of the initial instruction to \"take off and rise up to the top of the buildings.\"",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video begins with the agent at ground level between buildings. From 0:00 to approximately 0:15, the agent is seen steadily ascending, moving upwards until it is above the rooftops of the surrounding buildings, revealing a wider cityscape. This action directly corresponds to the initial instruction \"take off and rise up to the top of the buildings.\" The phrase \"fly over buildings\" accurately describes this process of ascending and being positioned above the buildings. The provided answer correctly identifies this action and links it to the initial instruction.",
