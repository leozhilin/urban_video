    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"rise to the top of the building,\" and the frames show a progression from a lower level to an elevated position, indicating that the agent is ascending. Therefore, the current action aligns with rising to the top of the building.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 31)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video begins with a dark, low-level view and progressively shows the agent ascending. From approximately 0:09 onwards, the view clearly transitions from a ground or very low level to a rooftop perspective, and then continues to rise higher, revealing more of the surrounding buildings and the cityscape below. This continuous upward movement directly corresponds to the first instruction given: \"rise to the top of the building.\" The provided answer correctly identifies this action and its alignment with the initial instruction.",
