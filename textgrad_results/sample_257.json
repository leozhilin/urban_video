  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [rise from the concrete and turn right. fly over the middle of the street until you reach the buildings on the left with the short concrete wall like structure around them. turn left right beside the buildings and fly along beside them. when you get to the middle darker brown building then angle straight up and fly toward the top of the building. before you get to the top turn right and begin to level off. fly toward the building with the half pipe or half circle design on the edge of the roof. when you get to the half circle then turn left and downward and fly toward the red roof of the smaller building beside the one you climbed. stop well before you get to the roof.]. At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. What are you doing now?  \nchoose:  \nA. When I reach the halfway circle, I turn left and go down, flying towards the red roof of the smaller building next to the one I climbed over.  \nB. I lift out of the concrete and turn right.  \nC. I turn left next to the building and fly along the side of the building.  \nD. I fly straight up and towards the top of the building.  \nE. I fly across the middle of the street until I reach the middle of the building on the left.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"rise from the concrete and turn right,\" which matches the starting point of the navigation. The first frame shows a view from ground level, indicating the start of the journey, and the subsequent frames show movement along the street, aligning with turning right and flying over the middle of the street. Therefore, the correct action at the initial position is to lift out of the concrete and turn right.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 12)]\nOption: B\nReason: The question asks what the agent is doing \"At the initial position\". The navigation instruction begins with \"rise from the concrete and turn right.\" The video starts at ground level (0:00-0:02), then the camera clearly begins to rise (0:02-0:07) and simultaneously starts turning right (0:07-0:12), aligning with the first part of the given instruction. Therefore, at the initial position, the agent is lifting out of the concrete and turning right. The provided answer correctly identifies this action and its corresponding instruction.",
