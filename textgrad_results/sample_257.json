    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"rise from the concrete and turn right,\" which matches the starting point of the navigation. The subsequent frames show a progression that begins with this action, indicating that the agent is following the first step of the given instructions.",
    "evaluation": "Let's analyze the video and the provided answer.\n- Location: [(0, 1)]\n- Option: B\n- Reason: The video starts with a view from the ground, then the camera rises and turns to the right. This corresponds to the instruction \"rise from the concrete and turn right\". Therefore, option B is the correct answer. The provided answer is correct.\n",
