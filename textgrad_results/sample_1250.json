  "question": "Question: After you fly between high-rise buildings, how does the distance between you and the high-rise buildings change?  \nChoice: A. I increase the distance.  \n           B. I decrease the distance.  \n           C. The distance remains constant.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: After flying between high-rise buildings, the agent would typically increase the distance from the buildings to avoid collision and navigate safely, which is a common behavior in such scenarios.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:50, 1:04)]\nOption: A\nReason: The video shows the agent flying very closely between high-rise buildings from approximately 0:35 to 0:50. After this period, specifically from 0:50 onwards, the agent begins to ascend and move away from the immediate proximity of the buildings. The buildings appear to get smaller in the frame, and the view opens up to more sky and rooftops, indicating that the agent is increasing its distance from the high-rise buildings. The provided answer correctly identifies that the distance increases, and the reasoning aligns with the visual evidence of the agent moving to a higher, more open vantage point.",
