At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. When you reach your current location, what is your Landmark Position from the shorter building?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am located on the left side of the shorter building.  \nB. I am located to the right of the shorter building.  \nC. I am located under a shorter building.  \nD. I am positioned above a shorter building.  \nE. I have nothing to do with shorter buildings.  ",

  "ground_truth": "D",
  "textgrad_result": {
    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The current perspective shows a view from above the rooftops of buildings, indicating that the agent is positioned above a shorter building. This aligns with option D, which states \"I am positioned above a shorter building.\" The surrounding structures are visible from an elevated vantage point, confirming this position.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:50, 2:19)]\nOption: D\nReason: The navigation instructions include \"fly high through the eds butcher shop signage\" and the video clearly shows the agent's perspective from an elevated position, looking down upon the rooftops and streets of the city from approximately 0:42 onwards, and consistently at the end of the video (1:50-2:19). From this high vantage point, the agent is positioned above all the buildings visible below, including any \"shorter building\" in the cityscape. Therefore, option D, \"I am positioned above a shorter building,\" accurately describes the agent's landmark position. The provided answer's reasoning is correct and aligns with the visual evidence.",
