    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The initial position shows a view of buildings and a road, but there is no visible underground parking entrance next to a house with a blue roof in the current field of view. The destination is not within sight from this perspective.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 10)]\nOption: C\nReason: The question asks whether the destination is within sight from a \"first-person perspective\" at the \"initial position\". While the prompt states the video presents first-person perception data, the provided video (00:00-00:10) is clearly an aerial, top-down map view of a residential complex, not a first-person view from an agent on the ground. Since no actual first-person perspective is provided, it is impossible to determine what is within the agent's field of view. Therefore, the destination is not in \"my field of view\" (as no such view is given). The provided answer correctly chooses Option C, but its reason is flawed. The destination (the blue-roofed house and the adjacent underground parking entrance) *is* clearly visible in the provided aerial map view (e.g., at 00:00, in the upper-left portion of the complex, a small building with a blue roof is visible, and next to it, a ramp leading down to the parking entrance). The error in the provided reason is claiming the destination is not visible in the \"current field of view\" (referring to the aerial view), when it is.",
