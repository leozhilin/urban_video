  "question": "Question: At the initial position, you are asked to navigate to the 30th-floor balcony. At the current location, if the balcony on the 30th floor is not within your field of view, what is the most relevant object in your field of view, and where is this object?  \nchoose:  \nA. The balcony on the 30th floor is already within my field of view.  \nB. I can't see the balcony on the 30th floor, but there is a bus stop in my lower view.  \nC. I can't see the balcony on the 30th floor, but there is a huge conical dome directly in front of me.  \nD. I cannot see the balcony on the 30th floor, but I can see the lake area in the park in my lower right corner.  \nE. I cannot see the balcony on the 30th floor, but I can see the facade of a low-rise building on the right side of my field of view.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The initial frames show a view between tall buildings with a huge conical dome directly in front, which is the most prominent object in the field of view. The balcony on the 30th floor is not visible from this perspective.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 14)]\nOption: C\nReason: At the initial position (0:00-0:02), the view is down a street between tall buildings, and a specific 30th-floor balcony is not visible. As the camera pans to the right (starting around 0:02), a large, brown conical dome becomes visible and highly prominent in the field of view, appearing on the right side from approximately 0:07. This makes it the most relevant and distinct object among the given choices. The provided answer's reason contains factual errors: the conical dome is not visible in the *absolute initial frames* (0:00-0:02), nor is it \"directly in front\" when it appears; it is on the right.",
