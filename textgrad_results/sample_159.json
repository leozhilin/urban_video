    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The provided frames show an aerial view of a building and its surroundings, but the perspective is from above, not from the initial position as described in the question. From this aerial view, the roof of a three-story building ahead is not within sight in the manner described by any of the options A to E, which suggest a first-person perspective at ground level. Therefore, the correct answer is that the destination is not within sight at the current location based on the given frames.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 55)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video shows an aerial view of the building and its surroundings. The question asks if the roof of a three-story building ahead is within sight from the initial position, implying a first-person perspective at ground level. Since the video provides an aerial view, it's impossible to determine if the destination is within sight from a ground-level, first-person perspective. Therefore, the destination is not within sight at the current location based on the given frames. The provided answer is correct.",
