  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [Raise the drone altitude, then change the camera gimbal from overhead to normal, fly towards the road, fly towards the sun after reaching the sky above the road, and finally turn right towards the residential building.]. You move according to a series of movement instructions. What direction is the road from you when you arrive at your current location?  \nchoose:  \nA. The road is on my left side.  \nB. The road is on my right side.  \nC. The road is behind me.  \nD. The road is in front of me.  \nE. The road is directly below me.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The video shows an aerial view where the road is directly below the drone's current position as it flies over the area. The perspective indicates that the drone is positioned above the road, making option E the correct choice.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:05, 2:20)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instructions guide the drone to \"fly towards the road\" (0:55-1:05) and then \"fly towards the sun after reaching the sky above the road\" (1:05-2:15). This sequence of movements places the drone at a significant altitude directly above the road. Even with the final instruction to \"turn right towards the residential building\" (2:15-2:20), the drone's vertical position relative to the road does not change; it remains hovering above it. As observed in the video from 1:05 until the end (2:20), the road is consistently visible directly beneath the drone. Therefore, the most accurate direction of the road from the drone's current location is \"directly below me\". The provided answer correctly identifies this spatial relationship.",
