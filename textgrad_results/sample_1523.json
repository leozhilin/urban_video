    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: To navigate to the first air conditioning unit on the left side of the top floor, the agent needs to rise to reach the top floor level. The current perspective is at a lower elevation relative to the target location, making rising the necessary next move.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:00, 0:08), (0:44, 1:02)]\nOption: A\nReason: At the initial position (0:00), the agent's perspective is very low, almost directly on the surface of a white rooftop. The question asks to navigate to \"the first air conditioning unit on the left side of the top floor.\" To reach the \"top floor level\" of any building, especially a multi-story one like the building with visible air conditioning units from 0:44 onwards, the agent must first gain significant altitude. Therefore, rising is the most logical and necessary immediate next move to achieve the required elevation for approaching the target. The video itself demonstrates this by showing the agent rising in the initial frames (0:00-0:08). The provided answer's reasoning is accurate.",
