    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"take off and look at the sea,\" which implies that the best next step is to fly forward while rising to gain a view of the sea. This aligns with option C, \"I fly forward while rising.\"",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 11)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video starts with a view of the sea. The instruction is to \"take off and look at the sea\". Since the camera is already looking at the sea, the next logical step is to take off, which means flying forward while rising. Therefore, option C is the best next step. The provided answer is correct.",
