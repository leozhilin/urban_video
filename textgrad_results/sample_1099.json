  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [take off and turn right until the edge of swimming pool and trees is on the right side view. fly forward until seeing the more buildings. turn right to seeing the big buildings. fly along the right edge of blue buildings.]. At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. What is your position relative to the park pond when you reach the current location?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am in the park pond.  \nB. I am on the left side of the park pond.  \nC. I am above the park pond.  \nD. I am on the right side of the park pond.  \nE. I am below the park pond.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The sequence of images shows the agent moving from an initial position and following the given navigation instructions. After turning right and flying forward, the agent reaches a position where the park pond is visible on the right side, indicating that the agent is on the left side of the park pond. Therefore, option B is the correct choice.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 235)]\nOption: B\nReason: The navigation instruction states \"take off and turn right until the edge of swimming pool and trees is on the right side view.\" From approximately 0:03 to 0:09, the agent performs this turn, and a large body of water, identified as the park pond, becomes clearly visible on the right side of the view. The subsequent instructions, \"fly forward until seeing the more buildings,\" \"turn right to seeing the big buildings,\" and \"fly along the right edge of blue buildings,\" describe movements that keep the park pond consistently on the agent's right side throughout the video (from 0:09 to 2:35). If the park pond is on the agent's right side, it logically follows that the agent is on the left side of the park pond. Therefore, the provided answer is correct.",
