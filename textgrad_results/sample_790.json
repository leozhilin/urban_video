  "question": "Question: You are navigating to the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank entrance next to the entrance of the huge conical dome building. What is the correct summary of your trajectory from the beginning to the current location?  \nChoice:  \nA. I started from a high-rise building, descended to street level, and moved towards Shanghai Pudong Development Bank.  \nB. I started from the left side of the building with a huge conical dome, turned right, and then descended to a certain height before heading towards the door of the building.  \nC. I started from a high-rise building, moved horizontally towards Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, and then descended to my current location.  \nD. I started from the park, rose to a high altitude, and then descended to my current position above the entrance of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank.  \nE. I started flying from the highway, flew around high-rise buildings, and then moved to my current position above Shanghai Pudong Development Bank.  ",

  "textgrad_result": {
    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The trajectory starts from a high altitude above the highway, moves around high-rise buildings, and then approaches the current position above the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank entrance. This matches the description in option E.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 39)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video begins with a wide aerial view from a very high altitude, showing a city landscape with prominent highways and numerous high-rise buildings (0:00-0:03). The agent then appears to move horizontally, revealing a large conical dome building (0:03-0:06). Following this, the agent performs a continuous descent, moving down alongside this conical dome building, with floor numbers visible on its side, indicating a direct approach to its entrance at ground level (0:07-0:39). This trajectory aligns best with option E: \"I started flying from the highway (implied by the high altitude view over the city with highways), flew around high-rise buildings (initial horizontal movement and pan), and then moved to my current position above Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (the descent towards the entrance of the conical dome building, which is the target).\" The provided answer correctly identifies Option E and provides a consistent reasoning.",
