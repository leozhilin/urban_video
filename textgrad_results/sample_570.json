    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The sequence of images shows a gradual ascent over the buildings, indicating that the agent is flying over buildings and gaining altitude. This aligns with the navigation instruction to \"Raise the altitude.\" Additionally, the view transitions from a closer look at individual buildings to a broader view of the area, further supporting the action of gaining altitude.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 32)]\nOption: [B]\nReason: From the beginning of the video to 0:32, the camera is gradually ascending over the buildings. This aligns with the navigation instruction to \"Raise the altitude.\" Additionally, the view transitions from a closer look at individual buildings to a broader view of the area, further supporting the action of gaining altitude.",
