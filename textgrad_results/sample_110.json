  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [Raise the drone altitude, then change the camera gimbal from overhead to normal, fly towards the road, fly towards the sun after reaching the sky above the road, and finally turn right towards the residential building.]. At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. What are you doing now?  \nchoose:  \nA. I go to the sky above the road and then fly towards the sun.  \nB. I go to the chair between the buildings.  \nC. I increase my height.  \nD. I have an aerial view of the streets.  \nE. I fly towards the road.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The drone is currently flying towards the road, as indicated by the visible path and surrounding environment in the frames. This aligns with the initial instruction to \"fly towards the road\" after raising the altitude and changing the camera gimbal. The other options do not match the current visual evidence of movement towards a road.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 44)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instructions are sequential: \"Raise the drone altitude, then change the camera gimbal from overhead to normal, fly towards the road...\". The video shows the drone executing these steps. From 0:00 to approximately 0:25, the drone is primarily raising its altitude and adjusting its camera gimbal from an overhead view to a more forward-looking perspective. After these initial adjustments, from approximately 0:25 to 0:44, the drone clearly begins and continues to move horizontally towards the road, which is visible in the distance and becomes more prominent. Therefore, the drone is currently in the process of flying towards the road, which is the next logical step after the initial altitude and camera adjustments. The provided answer correctly identifies this ongoing action.",
