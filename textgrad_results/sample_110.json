  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [Raise the drone altitude, then change the camera gimbal from overhead to normal, fly towards the road, fly towards the sun after reaching the sky above the road, and finally turn right towards the residential building.]. At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. What are you doing now?  \nchoose:  \nA. I go to the sky above the road and then fly towards the sun.  \nB. I go to the chair between the buildings.  \nC. I increase my height.  \nD. I have an aerial view of the streets.  \nE. I fly towards the road.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The drone is currently flying towards the road, as indicated by the visible pathways and the direction of movement in the frames. This aligns with the initial instruction to \"fly towards the road\" after raising the altitude and changing the camera gimbal. The subsequent steps in the navigation instruction have not yet been executed.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 44)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instructions are: \"Raise the drone altitude, then change the camera gimbal from overhead to normal, fly towards the road, fly towards the sun after reaching the sky above the road, and finally turn right towards the residential building.\"\n\nUpon reviewing the video:\n- From 0:00 to approximately 0:20, the drone is primarily raising its altitude, as indicated by the increasing aerial view.\n- From approximately 0:21 to 0:27, the camera gimbal changes from an overhead view to a more forward-looking, normal perspective.\n- From 0:27 onwards, the drone is at a higher altitude with a normal camera view, and it begins to move forward. The road is clearly visible in the direction of movement, indicating that the drone is now executing the instruction to \"fly towards the road.\" The subsequent instructions (flying towards the sun, turning right) have not yet been performed.\n\nTherefore, at the current point in the video (especially towards the end), the drone is flying towards the road. The provided answer is correct.",
