    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The next step for navigating to the roof of a nearby school\u2019s red classroom building from the current position (which appears to be above the school playground) would logically involve turning right. This is because the red classroom building is located to the right side of the current view, and turning right will align the path towards that building.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 53)]\nOption: E\nReason: From the initial position at 0:00, the school playground and the red classroom building are not immediately visible. The video demonstrates that the school campus, which contains both the playground and the target red classroom building, is located to the right of the agent's initial field of view. Therefore, the first logical step to begin navigating towards the red classroom building's roof is to turn right to orient towards the general area of the school campus. The provided answer's reason is flawed because it incorrectly states that the red classroom building is to the right of the view *after* the playground is visible (e.g., from 0:40 onwards, the red building is clearly on the left side of the frame). However, the chosen action \"I turn right\" is correct as an initial broad orientation from the very beginning of the video to locate the target area.",
