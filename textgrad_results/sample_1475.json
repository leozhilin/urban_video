    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 107)]\nOption: B\nReason: The question asks to navigate to a basketball court near a building from the initial position. The video provides an aerial view of a residential complex. As the camera zooms out and pans (especially from 0:50 onwards), a distinct green-colored basketball court becomes clearly visible in the upper-left portion of the screen, surrounded by buildings and green areas. Since the goal is to reach this specific basketball court, the most direct and logical next step is to approach it. The provided answer correctly identifies the basketball court as the target and states that it is clearly visible from the aerial view, making option B the correct choice.",
