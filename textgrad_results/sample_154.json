  "question": "Question: What is the correct summary of your trajectory from start to your current location while navigating to find the back door of a residential building?  \nChoice:  \nA. I start from above the high-rise building, adjust my perspective downward to overlook, pan left to the sky above the backyard, descend to the ground, and finally adjust my perspective upward to face the back door of the building.  \nB. I start from a high altitude, descend, move along the road to approach the building, and finally reach the building parking lot.  \nC. I start from the street, move along the sidewalk, and reach the green trash can at the back of the building.  \nD. I start from a point above the high-rise building, descend, move along the side of the building, approach the rear, and reach my current position near the parking lot.  \nE. I start from the park, rise to a high altitude, then descend to the ground near the building, and then move behind the building.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The trajectory starts from a high altitude providing an overview of the high-rise buildings, then descends and moves along the side of the building, approaching the rear area which includes a parking lot. This matches the sequence of images showing a transition from a wide aerial view to a closer view of the building's side and parking area.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 33)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video begins with an aerial view from a high altitude, showing multiple high-rise buildings and their surroundings (0:00). The camera then begins to descend (0:01-0:10), gradually getting closer to one specific building. As it descends, it also moves horizontally along the side of this building (0:11-0:25), with the building's facade and windows becoming prominent on the right side of the frame. The trajectory continues to move along the side, approaching what appears to be the rear or a different side of the building, and the final frames (0:26-0:33) show the agent at ground level, positioned near a parking lot adjacent to the building. This sequence of events perfectly matches the description in Option D: starting from above the building, descending, moving along its side, approaching the rear, and ending near the parking lot. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with this observation.",
