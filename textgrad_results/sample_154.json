  "question": "Question: What is the correct summary of your trajectory from start to your current location while navigating to find the back door of a residential building?  \nChoice:  \nA. I start from above the high-rise building, adjust my perspective downward to overlook, pan left to the sky above the backyard, descend to the ground, and finally adjust my perspective upward to face the back door of the building.  \nB. I start from a high altitude, descend, move along the road to approach the building, and finally reach the building parking lot.  \nC. I start from the street, move along the sidewalk, and reach the green trash can at the back of the building.  \nD. I start from a point above the high-rise building, descend, move along the side of the building, approach the rear, and reach my current position near the parking lot.  \nE. I start from the park, rise to a high altitude, then descend to the ground near the building, and then move behind the building.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The sequence of images shows a descent from an aerial view above the high-rise building, moving along the side of the building towards the rear area, and reaching a position near what appears to be a parking lot adjacent to the back of the building. This matches the description in option D.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 33)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video begins with an aerial view from above a high-rise building (00:00). The camera then proceeds to descend (00:01-00:10) while simultaneously moving along the side of the building (00:11-00:20). As it continues to descend and move, it clearly approaches the rear of the building, revealing a parking lot and green areas (00:21-00:33). The final frames show the agent's position near this parking lot at the back of the building. This trajectory perfectly matches the description in Option D: \"I start from a point above the high-rise building, descend, move along the side of the building, approach the rear, and reach my current position near the parking lot.\" The provided answer's reasoning is accurate and consistent with the visual evidence.",
