    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The trajectory starts from a high altitude providing an overview of the high-rise buildings, then descends and moves along the side of the building, approaching the rear area which includes a parking lot. This matches the sequence of images showing a transition from a wide aerial view to a closer view of the building's side and parking area.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 32)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video starts with a high-altitude view of the high-rise building (0-3s). Then, the camera descends and moves along the side of the building (3-32s), approaching the rear area, which includes a parking lot. This matches option D.\n",
