  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [take off and turn back and move forward towards the buildings till the brown building which have a glass on its top. now turn back and get closer to the blue building and get high and move forward till the pond arrives. now fly over the pond and move forward towards the road is visible. now turn left and move forward towards the buildings till the building have a banner named bolt cola. now move forward towards the buildings and get closer to the brown building and turn right and move forward till the road splits. now turn left and move forward towards the buildings till the blue building arrives and get closer to its bottom and stay there.]. At the initial position, you are instructed to follow a series of movement instructions. What are you doing now?  \nchoose:  \nA. I approach the blue building and climb higher.  \nB. I fly over the pond and toward the road.  \nC. I turn left and head toward the building until a banner named \"Bolt Cola\" appears on the building.  \nD. I go back, approach the blue building, and climb higher.  \nE. I head toward the building, approach the brown building, then turn right and continue until the road splits.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The sequence of images shows a progression from an open area with a pond towards a built-up area with buildings. The presence of a banner on one of the buildings in the later frames aligns with the instruction to move forward until a \"Bolt Cola\" banner is visible. This indicates that the agent is currently executing the part of the instruction that involves turning left and moving forward towards the buildings until the specified banner appears. Therefore, option C accurately describes the current action.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 45)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video begins with the agent taking off from an area near a fountain/pond and moving towards a city skyline. Around the 0:15 mark, a road becomes clearly visible, and the agent is positioned to move along it towards the buildings. From approximately 0:35 onwards, a large banner on one of the buildings becomes increasingly prominent as the agent approaches it. This visual evidence directly aligns with the navigation instruction: \"now turn left and move forward towards the buildings till the building have a banner named bolt cola.\" The agent is actively executing this part of the instruction by moving towards the building with the banner. Therefore, option C accurately describes the current action. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with the visual evidence and the sequence of instructions.",
