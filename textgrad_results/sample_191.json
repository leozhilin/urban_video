    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The sequence of images shows the agent navigating through the environment according to the given instructions. After taking off, turning left, going straight, and making subsequent turns as described, the agent reaches a position where the red car billboard is visible. The final frames indicate that the agent is located to the right of the red car billboard, as the billboard is on the left side of the view from the agent's perspective. Therefore, option E is the correct choice.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 41)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instructions guide the agent through a series of movements.\n1.  The agent takes off and turns left (0:00-0:05).\n2.  Goes straight and takes a right turn (0:05-0:12).\n3.  Goes straight and comes down the building level (0:12-0:16).\n4.  Takes a left turn (0:16-0:17). At this point (around 0:17), the red car billboard becomes visible on the right side of the agent's view.\n5.  Goes straight (0:17-0:20). The agent moves towards the billboard.\n6.  Turns right (0:20-0:22). After this right turn, the red car billboard is now on the *left* side of the agent's view (visible from 0:22 to 0:27).\n7.  Moves above the building level and goes straight (0:22-0:28). During this segment, the agent continues to move forward, and the billboard remains on the left side of the agent's perspective, gradually moving out of view as the agent passes it.\n8.  Comes slight down near apartment (0:28-0:41). The agent descends and moves further away from the billboard's location.\n\nAt the \"current location\" (the end of the video), the agent has followed all instructions. As the agent moved past the red car billboard, the billboard was consistently on the left side of the agent's view (from approximately 0:22 to 0:27). If an object is on the left side of your path as you move past it, you are located to the right of that object. Therefore, at the final position, the agent is located to the right of the red car billboard.\n\nThe provided answer's reasoning is correct: \"The final frames indicate that the agent is located to the right of the red car billboard, as the billboard is on the left side of the view from the agent's perspective.\"",
