    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The navigation instructions mention turning left at the front of the \"Dates Car Wash\" board and moving forward. Given the sequence of movements and the final position relative to \"Dave's Car Wash\" board, it is logical to conclude that the current location is to the right of Dave's Car Wash, as the agent has moved past it following the given directions.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:27, 1:35), (2:30, 2:35), (2:55, 3:05), (3:10, 3:15)]\nOption: D\nReason: To determine the landmark position from \"Dave's Car Wash\" board at the current location (end of the video), we need to trace the agent's movements and turns relative to the board.\n\n1.  **Initial encounter with \"Dave's Car Wash\"**: At approximately 1:27, the \"Dave's Car Wash\" billboard is visible on the right side of the screen. The instruction states \"turn left at front of the dates car wash board and move forward.\" As the agent approaches the board (around 1:35), it turns left. This means that after the turn, the \"Dave's Car Wash\" board is now to the agent's **right**. The agent then moves forward.\n\n2.  **Subsequent turns and their effect on relative position**:\n    *   The instruction then says \"turn back\" (around 2:30-2:35). A \"turn back\" implies a 180-degree turn. If the board was to the agent's right, after a 180-degree turn, it will now be to the agent's **left**.\n    *   Further along, the instruction states \"turn back\" again (around 2:55-3:05). Another 180-degree turn. If the board was to the agent's left, after this second 180-degree turn, it will once again be to the agent's **right**.\n    *   Finally, the instruction includes \"turn right\" (around 3:10). If the \"Dave's Car Wash\" board is to the agent's right, and the agent makes a right turn, the board will remain to the agent's **right** (e.g., if the agent was moving West and the board was East, turning right to North would place the board South-East, which is still to the agent's right).\n\nBased on this sequence of movements and turns, at the final location (the current location in the video), the \"Dave's Car Wash\" board is located to the right of the agent. The provided answer's option and reasoning are consistent with this analysis.",
