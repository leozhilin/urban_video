  "question": "Question: Which takes longer, your descent to the shop with the red sign displaying \"\u5b89\u4e2a\u5bb6\" or your navigation over the narrow pathway between tall structures?  \nChoices: A. My descent takes the same time as my navigation over the narrow pathway.  \n         B. My descent takes shorter than my navigation over the narrow pathway.  \n         C. My descent takes longer than my navigation over the narrow pathway.  ",

  "textgrad_result": {
    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The descent to the shop with the red sign displaying \"\u5b89\u4e2a\u5bb6\" involves a vertical movement which is typically faster due to gravity, whereas navigating over the narrow pathway between tall structures requires horizontal movement and potentially more careful maneuvering, which takes longer.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 40), (135, 139)]\nOption: B\nReason: The descent is shown from 0 to 40 seconds. The navigation over the narrow pathway is shown from 1:35 to 1:39. The descent takes longer than the navigation over the narrow pathway. Therefore, my descent takes shorter than my navigation over the narrow pathway.",
