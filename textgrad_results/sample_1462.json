  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [take off and turn little left and get high and move forward towards the buildings. now move forward and fly over the road and get down to the white line mark on the road. now turn back and move forward towards the buildings till the brown red building visible and get down to the building. now get high and move forward towards the buildings till the brown building steps visible. now fly over the buildings and get down to the chairs between the buildings and stay there.]. At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. What are you doing now?  \nchoose:  \nA. I turn around and head towards the building until I see the brown-red building.  \nB. I go to the building.  \nC. I stand tall and head toward the building until I see the steps of the brown building.  \nD. I fly over buildings.  \nE. I descend to the same level as the building on the street.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The sequence of images shows a progression from ground level to an aerial view, indicating that the agent is flying over the buildings. This aligns with the instruction \"now fly over the buildings and get down to the chairs between the buildings and stay there.\" The current position in the images reflects this flying action over the urban landscape.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 155)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video begins at ground level, but quickly shows the agent ascending (0:00-0:15). From approximately 0:15 onwards, and especially from 0:20 to the end of the video (1:55), the agent is clearly at a high altitude, moving across a cityscape with numerous buildings visible below. This visual evidence directly corresponds to the instruction \"now fly over the buildings\". While the full instruction includes \"and get down to the chairs between the buildings and stay there,\" the current state shown in the video is the \"fly over the buildings\" part, as the agent has not yet descended to the chairs. The provided answer correctly identifies this action based on the visual progression and alignment with the given navigation instructions.",
