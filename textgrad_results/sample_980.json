    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The trajectory starts from a street corner, rises vertically to the height of the building, and then moves horizontally along the building towards the first air conditioning unit on the left side of the top floor. This matches the sequence of events shown in the images where the perspective initially shows ground-level streets and gradually ascends to a higher vantage point alongside the building.",
