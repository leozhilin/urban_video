  "question": "Question: What is the correct summary of your trajectory from start to current position?  \nChoice:  \nA. I start from above the basketball court, move upward, backward, and then move right to my current position.  \nB. I start from above the basketball court, move upward, then move to the right, and reach my current position above the track and field.  \nC. I start from the street, move up to the roof of the building, then fly over the basketball court, and then move towards the track and field.  \nD. I start from above the basketball court, move upward and forward to the top of the track and field, and then descend to my current position.  \nE. I start from the parking lot, fly over the basketball court, then turn left into the track and field and reach my current location.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The trajectory starts from above the basketball court, moves upward, then shifts to the right, and reaches the current position above the track and field area. This matches the visual progression from the initial frames over the basketball court to the final frames directly above the track and field.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 142)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video begins with the camera positioned directly above a basketball court (0:00-0:14). As the video progresses, the camera clearly moves upward, gaining altitude and revealing a wider aerial view of the surrounding area, including buildings and a track and field. Simultaneously, the camera shifts horizontally to the right. This rightward movement is evident as the basketball court moves towards the bottom-left of the frame, and the track and field, initially to the left of the basketball court, gradually becomes centered in the view (0:15-1:00). The trajectory concludes with the camera positioned high above the track and field (1:00-1:42). Therefore, the summary \"I start from above the basketball court, move upward, then move to the right, and reach my current position above the track and field\" accurately describes the observed trajectory. Option A's inclusion of \"backward\" is not clearly supported by the visual evidence, as the primary lateral movement is to the right, and the basketball court moves towards the bottom-left, implying a forward and right movement relative to the initial frame's orientation. Options C, D, and E contain significant inaccuracies regarding the starting point, movement direction (descending), or final location.",
