    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The trajectory starts from a high altitude, as indicated by the initial wide view of the high-rise buildings and the surrounding area. The agent then approaches the high-rise buildings, providing a closer view of the structures. Afterward, the agent passes over a playground, which is visible in the frames showing the colorful play area with slides and other equipment. Finally, the agent flies towards the swimming pool, which is clearly shown in the later frames with detailed views of the pool's design and surrounding area. This sequence matches the description in option E.",
