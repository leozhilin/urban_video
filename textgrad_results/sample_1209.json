    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The sequence of images shows the agent navigating through a cityscape, moving over buildings and approaching specific landmarks as described in the navigation instructions. The current action, based on the provided frames, involves turning right and continuing forward, aligning with the instruction to \"now turn right and move forward and get down reach the front off brown building near to street light and landed.\" This matches option A, indicating the agent is turning right and keeping going.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(05:10, 06:05)]\nOption: A\nReason: The navigation instruction's final segment states: \"now turn right and move forward and get down reach the front off brown building near to street light and landed.\" Observing the video from approximately 05:10, the agent clearly executes a right turn. Following this turn, the agent continues to move forward while simultaneously descending towards the street level, eventually landing at the end of the video. Option A, \"I turn right and keep going,\" accurately describes the initial and ongoing movement within this final instruction, as the agent turns right and then continues its forward trajectory (while also descending) to reach the destination. The provided answer correctly identifies this phase of the navigation.",
