    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The navigation instruction indicates that after reaching the center of the lake, the next step is to \"take left go straight. take left go through buildings move forward until the road near blue three stored building look around see the blue postbox land near that.\" Given the current position appears to be above or near the lake, descending and then flying forward aligns with moving towards the next landmark, which involves navigating through buildings and finding a specific road and postbox. This requires a descent to get closer to the ground level where these details can be observed.",
