    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:00, 1:18), (1:20, 1:51)]\nOption: A\nReason: The navigation instructions state to \"go over the trees and beside pond\" which occurs around the 1:00-1:18 mark, where a pond is clearly visible to the right of the agent's path. Following this, the instructions direct the agent to \"move forward and go over the road and beside buildings and little turn left and move forward and go over the intersection road and get down and by up and turn right and move forward. now move forward and slightly turn right and get down at front of the optician wooden board and land there.\" The video from 1:20 to 1:51 shows the agent moving through an urban environment with tall buildings and streets, eventually landing on a street. The pond is no longer visible in these later segments. Therefore, at the current (final) location, the agent is far away from the pond. The provided answer is correct.",
