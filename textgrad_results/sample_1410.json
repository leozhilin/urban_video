    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:50, 2:57)]\nOption: D\nReason: The question asks for the next move to navigate to an elevator located \"to the left of the entrance\" from an \"initial position\". While the video does not show a first-person perspective from the ground level at an \"initial position\", it does provide a clear view of the building's entrance area (visible from approximately 1:50 onwards). Assuming the agent is at the entrance and needs to reach an object specified as being to its left, the most logical and immediate \"next move\" to orient towards that target is to \"turn left\". This action aligns the agent's view and potential path with the target location. The provided answer's reasoning is consistent with this logical deduction.",
