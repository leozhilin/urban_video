  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [turn around. fly forward over the buildings to the next road. turn around and fly forward. go to above the four lane highway on the left. fly down to the intersection and stop. turn left at the billboard. fly over the buildings to the left. go towards the water. stop one block away from the water and lower down into the alley. turn around and fly forward one block. go to the taller dark building. lower down to the road. turn left. fly to the white building. fly over the building and go to the next road. stop in front of the red brick building.]. At the initial position, you are asked to navigate according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I fly forward and rise.  \nB. I descend and then turn around.  \nC. I rotate the camera downward.  \nD. I turn left and go up.  \nE. I fly forward while descending.  ",

  "textgrad_result": {
    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"turn around,\" which suggests that the agent should first change its orientation before proceeding with the next steps. Therefore, the best next step is to descend and then turn around, aligning with the given navigation instruction.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 14)]\nOption: B\nReason: The navigation instruction given at the initial position explicitly starts with \"turn around.\" Among the provided options, Option B is the only one that includes the action \"turn around.\" While the option also states \"descend,\" which contradicts the visual evidence in the video (the agent is seen rising from 0:00 to 0:07) and the subsequent instruction to \"fly forward over the buildings\" (which would require gaining altitude, not descending), it is the only choice that directly addresses the primary and immediate command in the navigation instruction. The provided answer correctly identifies \"turn around\" as the key action from the instruction, but incorrectly includes \"descend\" in its reasoning and chosen option.",
