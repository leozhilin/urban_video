    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The flight path begins above a street with shops and apartment buildings, then flies over a busy street and a large intersection. It continues past several apartment buildings and a vacant lot before descending towards the underground garage entrance, which matches the sequence described in option A.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 120)]\nOption: A\nReason: The video begins at 0:00 with an aerial view above a street lined with shops and tall apartment buildings. From 0:10 to approximately 0:30, the camera pans right, revealing a busy street and a large intersection in the distance, with numerous cars. Throughout the first minute of the video, the flight path passes by several apartment buildings and a prominent vacant lot (e.g., visible from 0:20 to 0:50). Finally, from around 1:00, the camera descends steadily towards a covered entrance located between two apartment buildings, which clearly appears to be the entrance to an underground garage. This sequence of events perfectly matches the description provided in Option A. The provided answer's reasoning is accurate.",
