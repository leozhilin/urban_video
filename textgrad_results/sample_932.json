    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current location is directly above the center of the elevator on the right side of the entrance, as indicated by the perspective and alignment with the elevator structure in the images.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 114)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video begins with an aerial view of a city, showing the agent at a very high altitude. As the video progresses, the camera descends and moves closer to a specific building. From approximately 0:50 onwards, the camera's perspective shifts to directly overlook the base of the building. In the final frames (around 1:00-1:14), the camera is positioned almost perfectly above the glass elevator structure located on the right side of the building's entrance, looking straight down into it. This clearly indicates that the current location is directly above the center of the elevator. The provided answer is correct.",
