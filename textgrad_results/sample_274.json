    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: Based on the navigation instructions and the sequence of images, the agent moves through various landmarks including bridges and buildings. The final frames show a view from a high vantage point overlooking water, indicating the agent has moved to a position relative to a billboard (assuming the \"red and white bottle cap\" is a notable landmark similar to a billboard). The perspective suggests the agent is now to the right of this landmark, as the view is expansive and not obstructed by it. Therefore, option D is the most plausible.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(410, 414)]\nOption: [D]\nReason: The video ends with the agent positioned on a rooftop next to a red and white bottle cap billboard. The camera pans to show the billboard on the right side of the agent's view. Therefore, the agent is located to the right of the billboard.",
