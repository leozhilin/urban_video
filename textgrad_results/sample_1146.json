    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The journey begins at a fountain in the center of a square, as seen in the initial frames with the fountain and statue prominently displayed. It ends at an intersection by the sea, evident from the final frames showing a view of the ocean and a streetlamp at what appears to be a coastal intersection.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 7), (1, 45, 1, 52)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video clearly begins in a park or square, with a prominent fountain and statue visible in the foreground from 0:00 to 0:07. The journey then progresses through a city. Towards the end of the video, specifically from 1:45 to 1:52, the view opens up to a large body of water, which appears to be the sea, at the end of a city street. The final frames show a street leading directly to this waterfront, with what looks like an intersection or open area before the sea, confirming the ending point as an intersection by the sea. The provided answer aligns perfectly with this visual evidence.",
