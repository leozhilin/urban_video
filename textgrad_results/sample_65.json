I approach sidewalks adjacent to high-rise buildings.  \nB. I approach the entrance of a high-rise building.  \nC. I approach green spaces near high-rise buildings.  \nD. I approach the parking lot next to the high-rise building.  \nE. I approach rooftops of adjacent buildings.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: To navigate to the store with the signboard \"\u8d1d\u58f3\u751f\u9c9c Food,\" approaching sidewalks adjacent to high-rise buildings is a logical step. This path likely provides access to various commercial areas, including the desired store. The sidewalks offer a clear and safe route for navigation within the urban environment depicted in the images.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 17)]\nOption: A\nReason: The video provides an aerial overview of an urban environment featuring high-rise buildings, roads, and clearly defined sidewalks. The question asks for the next step to navigate to a store from an initial position (implied to be an aerial or high-level view). To reach a ground-level store, the agent must transition to pedestrian navigation. Sidewalks are the primary and safest pathways for pedestrians in an urban setting, providing direct access to commercial establishments, which are typically located at the ground level of buildings. Therefore, approaching the sidewalks adjacent to the high-rise buildings is the most logical and appropriate first step for ground-level navigation towards the destination store. The provided answer correctly identifies Option A and offers a sound reasoning that aligns with this analysis.",
