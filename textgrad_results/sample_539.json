    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The current location is directly above the road, as indicated by the aerial view showing the road running beneath the drone's position. This means the road is directly below the drone when it arrives at its current location.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:20, 1:59)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instructions lead the drone to fly towards and then above the road. At the \"current location,\" which is the final state of the video (from approximately 1:20 onwards), the drone is at a high altitude with its camera pointed downwards. The road is clearly visible directly beneath the drone's position, extending into the distance. Therefore, the road is directly below the drone. The provided answer correctly identifies this.",
