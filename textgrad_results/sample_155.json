    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The sequence of images shows the agent has completed the navigation instructions and is now at the final destination, which is the brown building. The last part of the instruction states to \"retrace my steps to the brown building and stay there,\" indicating that the agent has reached this point and is staying there.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(2:36, 4:05)]\nOption: B\nReason: The navigation instructions describe a sequence of movements. The last instruction is \"now turn back reach the brown building and stay there.\" The video shows the agent completing the previous steps, and from approximately 2:36 onwards, the agent is positioned on top of the brown building and remains stationary, observing the surroundings. This directly corresponds to the final instruction to \"reach the brown building and stay there.\" Therefore, the agent is retracing its steps (or at least returning) to the brown building and staying there.",
