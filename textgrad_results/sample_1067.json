  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [go to sun. go to brown building. go towards trees.]. At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. What are you doing now?  \nchoose:  \nA. I go to the trees.  \nB. I go to the chair between the buildings.  \nC. I turn back.  \nD. I go to the brown building.  \nE. I go and bask in the sun.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The sequence of images shows the agent initially moving towards a brown building and then proceeding towards an area with numerous trees, indicating that the current action is going to the trees as per the navigation instructions.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1, 4), (11, 15), (51, 55), (111, 147)]\nOption: A\nReason: The video shows the agent performing a full 360-degree panoramic scan from a fixed initial position. The agent does not translate (move forward or backward) at any point in the video. The navigation instructions are given as a sequence: \"go to sun. go to brown building. go towards trees.\" The panoramic scan allows the agent to survey the environment and identify potential targets for these instructions. The video concludes with the agent's view clearly oriented towards a large area with numerous trees (from approximately 1:11 to 1:47). This final orientation aligns with the last instruction, \"go towards trees,\" indicating that this is the agent's current objective or the next action it is preparing to take.\n\nThe provided answer's reason states that the agent is \"initially moving towards a brown building and then proceeding towards an area with numerous trees.\" This is incorrect. The agent is not *moving* (translating) towards any object; it is *rotating* to observe its surroundings. However, the conclusion that the current action (or intent) is \"going to the trees\" is reasonable, given the final orientation and the sequence of instructions.",
