  "question": "Question: At the initial position, you are asked to navigate to the sixth-floor balcony. At the current location, if the balcony on the sixth floor is not in view, what is the most relevant object in view, and where is this object?  \nchoose:  \nA. I can\u2019t see the balcony on the 6th floor, but there is a bus stop below my view.  \nB. I can already see the balcony on the 6th floor.  \nC. The balcony on the 6th floor cannot be seen, but the main entrance of a high-rise building across the street is on the left side of my field of view.  \nD. The balcony on the 6th floor cannot be seen, but there is the roof of a high-rise building on the right side of my view.  \nE. The balcony on the 6th floor cannot be seen, but the facade of a low-rise building is on the left side of my view.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The balcony on the sixth floor is not in view, but the main entrance of a high-rise building across the street is on the left side of the field of view. This is evident from the initial frames where the perspective shows a high-rise building with its entrance visible on the left side before the agent moves closer to the target building.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1)]\nOption: C\nReason: At the initial position (00:00), the camera is at a high altitude, showing a panoramic view of a city. The balcony on the sixth floor of any specific building is not visible from this distance and perspective. A very prominent high-rise building is clearly visible on the left side of the field of view. While the \"main entrance\" itself is not explicitly detailed or zoomed in, the lower part of this high-rise building, where an entrance would be located, is indeed on the left side of the frame. This building serves as a relevant landmark in the initial view for navigation. Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect because:\nA. There is no bus stop visible from this high aerial perspective.\nB. The balcony on the 6th floor is not visible at the initial position.\nD. While there are roofs of high-rise buildings, the most prominent and clearly identifiable high-rise as a landmark is on the left, not specifically \"on the right side of my view\" as the primary relevant object.\nE. The prominent building on the left side of the view is a high-rise, not a low-rise building.\n\nThe provided answer correctly identifies that the 6th-floor balcony is not in view and points to the high-rise building on the left as the most relevant object, which aligns with the visual evidence.",
