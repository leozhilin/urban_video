  "question": "Question: Which takes longer, your flight along the straight road towards the pavilion or your slight adjustment to align with the road\u2019s curve?  \nChoices:  \nA. My flight along the straight road takes longer than my slight adjustment to align with the road\u2019s curve.  \nB. My flight along the straight road takes shorter than my slight adjustment to align with the road\u2019s curve.  \nC. My flight along the straight road takes the same time as my slight adjustment to align with the road\u2019s curve.  ",

  "textgrad_result": {
    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The sequence of images shows a longer duration spent on the straight road as the agent moves forward consistently over multiple frames before making a slight adjustment to align with the road\u2019s curve, which appears to be a quicker maneuver.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 25), (28, 32)]\nOption: A\nReason: The video clearly depicts the agent moving along a straight section of the road from the beginning (00:00) until approximately 00:25. This period involves consistent forward movement without significant directional changes. Subsequently, the road begins to curve, and the agent performs a noticeable adjustment to align with this curve, which occurs roughly between 00:28 and 00:32. Comparing the duration, the straight flight segment (approx. 25 seconds) is significantly longer than the adjustment segment (approx. 4-5 seconds). The provided answer correctly identifies that the flight along the straight road takes longer.",
