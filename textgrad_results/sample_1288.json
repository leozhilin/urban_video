    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The video starts with a high-altitude view of a city street, showing a broad perspective of the urban environment. As the sequence progresses, it ends at a roadside store with a gray sign, which is clearly visible in the later frames. This matches the description in option B.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 3), (1:35, 1:39)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video begins with a high-altitude, wide shot of a city street, showing multiple high-rise buildings and a broad urban landscape, which matches \"Start with a high-altitude view of a city street\". The video then gradually descends and zooms in, concluding with a close-up view of several ground-level shops. One of these shops, clearly visible in the final frames, has a prominent gray sign, fitting the description \"end at a roadside store with a gray sign\". Therefore, option B accurately describes the starting and ending points of the video. The provided answer is consistent with this analysis.",
