    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The navigation instruction starts with \"rise,\" which is the first action to be taken from the initial position. The subsequent frames show an ascent, aligning with this initial command. Therefore, the correct choice is E.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 30)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instruction given at the initial position explicitly states \"rise\" as the very first action. The video frames from 0:00 onwards clearly show the agent's perspective moving upwards, gaining altitude from the initial low viewpoint near the water to a higher position overlooking the city. This visual evidence directly corresponds to the \"rise\" instruction. The provided answer correctly identifies this.",
