  "question": "Question: Starting from your initial position, you are required to navigate to an underground garage near a residential area consisting of gray buildings in front of you. How can your trajectory from the starting position to the current position be correctly summarized?  \nChoice: A. Start from the parking lot, head toward the road, then turn left toward the building.  \n           B. Start from the edge of the building, move backward along the street, and then descend into the parking lot.  \n           C. Launch from above a building, descend to the street, and then move toward an open space.  \n           D. Start from the parking lot near the building group, move toward a street, fly over the street, and move forward to reach the current position above the open space.  \n           E. Start from the street and fly over some trees, streets, and open spaces, moving toward a group of tall buildings.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The trajectory described in option D matches the visual progression of the frames. Starting from a parking lot near a building group, moving toward a street, flying over the street, and then reaching an open space aligns with the observed movement from a high vantage point overlooking buildings, streets, and open areas.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 59)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video begins with an aerial view showing a parking lot adjacent to a group of tall buildings, with a street running alongside. As the video progresses, the camera moves backward and slightly upward, effectively flying over the street that was initially in the foreground. The movement continues, revealing a large, undeveloped open space, and the camera's final position is clearly above this open space, looking out over the broader urban landscape. Option D accurately summarizes this trajectory: starting with a view of the parking lot near the building group, moving over the street, and then continuing to move (forward along its flight path, which is backward relative to the initial view) to reach a position above the open space. The provided answer's reasoning is correct as it aligns with the visual progression observed in the video.",
