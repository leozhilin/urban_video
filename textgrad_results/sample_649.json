  "question": "Question: You are navigating to a nearby bus stop. What is the correct summary of your trajectory from the start to the current location?  \nChoice:  \nA. Start from a high-rise building, descend to street level, and move toward a bus stop.  \nB. Start from the street, move along the road, pass several high-rise buildings, and arrive near the current bus stop.  \nC. Start from the park, rise to the roof of the high-rise building, and then move to the current location overlooking the bus stop.  \nD. Start from the roof of a high-rise building, fly across the road and parking lot, and then descend to your current position above the bus stop.  \nE. Start from the scooter lane in the park, turn left to face the street outside the park, rise to the height of the high-rise building across the street, move forward, and stop at your current position above the bus.

    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The video starts with a view from a high vantage point, overlooking high-rise buildings and then moves forward, descending towards the street level where a bus stop is visible. This matches the description in option D, which states starting from the roof of a high-rise building, flying across the road and parking lot, and then descending to the current position above the bus stop.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 240)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video begins with an aerial perspective, showing a high-rise building and then panning out to reveal a vast city landscape from a significant altitude (0:00-0:12). This indicates a starting point high above the ground, consistent with \"from the roof of a high-rise building\" or a similar high vantage point. From this elevated position, the camera proceeds to move forward and continuously descends (0:12-1:50), passing over various urban elements such as roads, parking lots, and other buildings. The trajectory culminates with the camera positioned directly above a bus stop on the street (1:50-2:40), where the words \"\u516c\u4ea4\u7ad9\" (bus stop) are visible on the road and people are waiting at the shelter. Therefore, the trajectory accurately involves starting high, \"flying across\" the urban landscape, and \"descending to the current position above the bus stop.\" The provided answer's reasoning is correct and aligns with the visual evidence.",
