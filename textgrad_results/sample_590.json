  "question": "Question: If you don't fly directly over the trees, but instead fly around the park, can you still maintain your position above the trees in the center of the park?  \nChoice: A. I can accomplish the task because I avoid areas with denser trees, but the alternative movement will take longer.  \n          B. I cannot complete my mission because I end up outside the park area.  \n          C. I can maintain position because I hug the park boundaries and the alternative motion is faster.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: By flying around the park instead of directly over the trees, you can still maintain a position above the center of the park. This approach helps in avoiding denser areas of trees, ensuring safety and stability. However, this alternative route will indeed take longer compared to a direct flight over the trees.",

If the agent flies around the park boundaries, it can still maintain a position above the trees in the center of the park. However, this alternative route will take longer than flying directly over the trees.",
