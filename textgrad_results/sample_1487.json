  "question": "Question: After you descend further and move forward over the target building, what is the next step?  \nOptions:  \nA. I rise to a higher altitude.  \nB. I turn left to align with another building.  \nC. I hover in place before descending.  \nD. I descend to a position directly above the roof of the target building.  \nE. I move backward to adjust my position.",

    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The agent has moved forward over the target building and the next logical step is to descend to a position directly above the roof of the target building, as indicated by the downward movement and focus on the rooftop in the final frames.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 24), (0, 25), (0, 50), (1, 22)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video initially shows a wide aerial view of the city. From approximately 0:25, the agent begins to descend and move forward, focusing on a low-rise building complex. By 0:50, the agent is clearly positioned above the target building and continues a steady downward movement. The subsequent frames (from 0:50 to 1:22) show the agent descending further, getting progressively closer to the roof of this building, until the camera is looking almost directly down onto the rooftop. This continuous downward motion directly over the building indicates that the next step is to descend to a position directly above its roof. The provided answer correctly identifies this action and its supporting visual evidence.",
