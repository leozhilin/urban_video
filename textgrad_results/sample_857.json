The video starts with a top-down view of the cityscape. We need to look for a purple ledge on a building below.\n\n**Evaluation of the Provided Answer:**\n\nThe provided answer states that the purple ledge is not visible in the initial frames. This seems correct based on the initial top-down view.\n\n**My Answer:**\n\nLocation: [(0, 7)]\nOption: [D]\nReason: The initial frames (0-7 seconds) show a top-down view of the cityscape.
