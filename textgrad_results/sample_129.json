At the initial position, you are asked to navigate according to a series of movement instructions. What is the Landmark Position from the pond when you reach your current location?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am located on the left side of the pond.  \nB. I am far away from the pond.  \nC. I am located above the pond.  \nD. I am located on the right side of the pond.  \nE. I am located below the pond.

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current location, as described by the final frames, is near the bottom of a blue building, which is far from the pond. The pond was passed earlier in the navigation sequence, and the agent has moved forward significantly since then, indicating that the pond is now far away.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:30, 2:25), (3:40, 3:59)]\nOption: B\nReason: The navigation instructions state \"now fly over the pond and move forward towards the road is visible. now turn left and move forward towards the buildings till the building have a banner named bolt cola. now move forward towards the buildings and get closer to the brown building and turn right and move forward till the road splits. now turn left and move forward towards the buildings till the blue building arrives and get closer to its bottom and stay there.\". The video shows the agent flying over the pond between 1:50 and 2:25. After this, the agent continues to navigate through the city, making several turns and moving towards various buildings, including one with a \"bolt cola\" banner and a brown building, before finally arriving at the bottom of a blue building at the end of the video (3:40-3:59). Given the extensive movement and turns after passing the pond, the current location is clearly far away from the pond. The provided answer correctly identifies this.",
