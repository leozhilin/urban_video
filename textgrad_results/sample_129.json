At the initial position, you are asked to navigate according to a series of movement instructions. What is the Landmark Position from the pond when you reach your current location?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am located on the left side of the pond.  \nB. I am far away from the pond.  \nC. I am located above the pond.  \nD. I am located on the right side of the pond.  \nE. I am located below the pond.

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current location, as described by the final frames, is near a blue building's bottom. The pond was passed earlier in the navigation instructions (\"now fly over the pond and move forward till the road is visible\"), indicating that the agent is now far away from the pond. Therefore, option B is the most accurate description of the landmark position from the pond at the current location.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:55, 2:25), (3:50, 3:59)]\nOption: B\nReason: The navigation instructions clearly state \"now fly over the pond and move forward till the road is visible\" (1:55-2:25). After this, the agent performs several more movements: turning left, moving towards buildings, getting closer to a brown building, turning right, moving until the road splits, turning left again, and finally moving towards a blue building to get closer to its bottom (3:50-3:59). This extensive sequence of movements after passing the pond indicates that the agent is now a significant distance away from the pond. Therefore, the current location is far away from the pond. The provided answer is correct.",
