    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The next step should be to turn right towards the seller's store, which is located behind the nearby bus stop. The current view shows a street with a bus stop and stores, indicating that turning right will likely lead to the desired location.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:00, 0:12)]\nOption: E\nReason: From the initial position at the beginning of the video (0:00), the camera is focused on a building. To navigate to a seller's store behind a nearby bus stop, which is part of the wider city environment, the first significant action taken by the agent (camera) is to pan or \"turn right\" (from approximately 0:06 to 0:12). This turn reveals the city landscape where the bus stop and stores are located, thus orienting the agent towards the destination. The provided reason incorrectly states that \"The current view shows a street with a bus stop and stores\" at the initial position; this view is only achieved after the initial turning and subsequent descending movements.",
