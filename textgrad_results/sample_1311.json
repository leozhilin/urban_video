I approach the edge of the community park.  \nB. I approach the center of the intersection.  \nC. I approach the roof of the building on the left.  \nD.

    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The goal is to navigate to a small two-story house with a blue roof. From the current perspective, the most direct and relevant action is to approach the two-story building with the blue roof, as it matches the description of the destination. Other options like approaching the edge of the community park, the center of the intersection, the roof of the building on the left, or the top of the tallest building do not align with the specific goal of reaching the small two-story house with a blue roof.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 41)]\nOption: D\nReason: The question asks to navigate to a \"small two-story house with a blue roof.\" Upon reviewing the video, particularly in the initial frames (e.g., 0:00-0:02), a small building with a distinct blue roof is visible in the bottom-left portion of the community. This building stands out from the much larger, multi-story apartment complexes. While the exact number of stories (two-story) is difficult to confirm precisely from this aerial perspective, it is the only structure that matches the \"small\" and \"blue roof\" description provided as the destination. Therefore, for high-level planning, the most direct and logical next step to reach this specific destination is to approach the building itself. Options A and B are too general, while options C and E involve approaching roofs or the top of the tallest building, which are not relevant actions for ground-level navigation to a house. The provided answer correctly identifies the most appropriate action based on the goal and visual evidence.",
