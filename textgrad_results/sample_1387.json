    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: After adjusting the perspective upward from above the school runway, the next step is to turn right and face the parking lot between the two buildings. This is evident from the sequence of frames where the view transitions from the school runway to a position overlooking the parking lot situated between two buildings.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:25, 0:36)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video begins with an overhead view of a school runway. Around the 0:25 mark, the camera begins to adjust its perspective upward (tilting from a top-down view to a more angled, horizontal view) and simultaneously starts to pan to the right. This rightward turn continues, and by 0:36, the camera is clearly facing a large parking lot situated between several buildings. Therefore, the next step after adjusting the perspective upward is to turn right and face the parking lot between the buildings. The provided answer correctly identifies this sequence of events.",
