    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: After passing the central building, the agent deflects slightly to the right to align with the shoreline skyscraper skyline, as indicated by the gradual shift in perspective towards the waterfront buildings.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:14, 0:20)]\nOption: E\nReason: After passing the central building around 0:14, the agent begins to deflect slightly to the right. This maneuver positions the agent to fly along the shoreline, bringing the distant skyscraper skyline into view and aligning the flight path with it, as clearly seen from 0:15 onwards. The provided answer is correct and aligns with the visual evidence.",
