  "question": "Question: Which would take longer, flying over a lake or moving along a tree-lined path?  \nChoice: A. I spent more time flying over the lake than I did along the tree-lined path.  \n           B. My flight time over the lake is shorter than the time it takes to move along a tree-lined path.  \n           C. I spent the same amount of time flying over the lake as I did along the tree-lined path.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The sequence of images shows that the agent initially moves along a tree-lined path and then flies over a lake. The frames depicting the flight over the lake are fewer compared to those showing movement along the tree-lined path, suggesting that the flight time is shorter.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 17), (17, 36)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video shows the agent moving along a tree-lined path from 0 to 17 seconds. From 17 to 36 seconds, the agent is flying over a lake. The duration of the tree-lined path segment is shorter than the lake segment. Therefore, the flight time over the lake is shorter than the time it takes to move along a tree-lined path.",
