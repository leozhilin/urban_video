    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The roof of the red teaching building is visible on the right side of the field of view as the agent approaches it. The building's red color and structure are clearly identifiable, and its roof becomes more prominent as the perspective shifts closer to it.",
    "evaluation": "Here's my evaluation of the provided answer:\n\nOption: E\nReason: From the initial frames of the video (0:00-0:05), the red teaching building is not visible. As the camera pans and the perspective shifts (0:35-0:45), the red teaching building comes into view on the right side of the screen. Therefore, the roof of the red teaching building is indeed visible on the right side of the field of view.\n",
