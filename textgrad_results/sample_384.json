    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The drone's current location, as indicated by the sequence of images, places it in a position where Charlie's Chocolate Mansion (identified by the sign) is to the west. The perspective and surrounding buildings suggest that the drone has moved past the landmark and is now viewing it from a distance to its west.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(2:15, 2:25)]\nOption: B\nReason: The \"Charlie's Chocolate\" sign is clearly visible on the roof of a building from approximately 2:15 to 2:25. At this point, the drone is moving forward, and the building with the sign is located to the right of the drone's field of view. As the drone continues its movement, the building with the sign shifts towards the right-rear of the frame, indicating that the drone has moved past the landmark.\n\nTo determine the relative position, we need to establish a consistent cardinal direction.\n1.  **Sun Position**: At around 0:15, the sun is bright and appears on the left side of the screen, casting shadows to the right. This suggests the sun is either in the East (if the drone is facing North) or in the West (if the drone is facing South).\n2.  **Drone's General Movement**: The drone generally moves towards a large body of water visible in the distance. If we assume the sun on the left (East) and the drone moving towards the water, it's plausible that the water is in the South, and the drone is moving South.\n3.  **Relative Position**: If the drone is moving South, and the \"Charlie's Chocolate\" building is to its right, then the building is to the West of the drone's path. Therefore, the drone's current location is to the **East** of Charlie's Chocolate Mansion.\n\nThe question asks for the drone's Landmark Position *from* Charlie's Chocolate Mansion. If the drone is East of the mansion, then from the mansion, the drone is to the East.\n\nThe provided answer states: \"The drone's current location... places it in a position where Charlie's Chocolate Mansion (identified by the sign) is to the west.\" This first part of their reasoning aligns with my conclusion that the drone is East of the mansion (i.e., the mansion is to the west of the drone). However, the second part of their reasoning",
