At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is your best next step?  \nchoose:  \nA. I turn left and go up.  \nB. I descend and then fly forward.  \nC. I fly forward while rotating the camera upward.  \nD. I fly forward and turn right.  \nE. I rotate the camera down and then to the right.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"take off then move forward towards the tall building then turn left and move forward.\" Given the starting position on a rooftop with a clear view of the cityscape, the best next step is to fly forward while rotating the camera upward to align with the direction towards the tall building as instructed. This matches option C.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 5)]\nOption: C\nReason: The initial position is on a rooftop, and the first instruction is \"take off then move forward towards the tall building\". To \"take off\" implies gaining altitude. To \"move forward towards the tall building\" from this rooftop perspective, the agent needs to fly horizontally in that direction. As the agent takes off and moves forward, the tall building, which is initially seen somewhat above the current eye level (especially considering the rooftop in the foreground), would require the camera to rotate upward to keep it in view and align with the direction of movement. Therefore, \"fly forward while rotating the camera upward\" (Option C) is the most appropriate next step, combining the ascent (implied by \"take off\" and upward camera rotation to clear the immediate foreground) and the forward movement towards the target. The video from 0:05 to 0:15 visually confirms this initial upward and forward movement with the camera adjusting its pitch. The provided answer is correct.",
