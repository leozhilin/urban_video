    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The swimming pool is not visible within the current field of view. The frames show residential buildings and a playground area, but no swimming pool can be seen.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 121)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video starts with a wide aerial view of a residential community. As the camera pans and zooms in, it reveals various parts of the community, including multiple high-rise buildings, landscaped green areas, and pathways. A blue and yellow patterned area is visible on the ground between some buildings (e.g., clearly seen from 0:20 onwards), which is identified as a children's playground with text like \"HAPPY CHILDHOOD\" and \"YAHOO\". There is no visible swimming pool anywhere within the field of view at the initial position or as the camera explores the immediate community area. Therefore, the destination (swimming pool) is not within sight. The provided answer is correct.",
