  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [take off and move forward and get down at above statue and turn left and move forward and go over the trees and beside pond. now move forward and go over the road and beside buildings and little turn left and move forward and go over the intersection road and get down and by up and turn right and move forward. now move forward and slightly turn right and get down at front of the optician wooden board and land there.]. You move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I fly forward and then rise.  \nB. I drop down and turn right.  \nC. I rotate the camera downward.  \nD. I turn left and go up.  \nE. I fly forward while descending and turning slightly to the right.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The navigation instruction specifies to \"fly forward while descending and turning slightly to the right\" as the next step, which aligns with moving towards the optician wooden board as described in the instructions. This action continues the forward movement while adjusting direction slightly to the right, preparing for the final descent.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 31)]\nOption: E\nReason: The question asks for the best next step based on the provided comprehensive navigation instruction. While the video only depicts the initial segment of this instruction (up to \"go over the trees and beside pond\"), the options and the provided answer's reasoning indicate that the question is implicitly asking for the next step when the agent is at the point just before the final destination. The last part of the navigation instruction states: \"now move forward and slightly turn right and get down at front of the optician wooden board and land there.\" Option E, \"I fly forward while descending and turning slightly to the right,\" perfectly aligns with these three actions: \"fly forward\" (move forward), \"descending\" (get down), and \"turning slightly to the right\" (slightly turn right). Therefore, the provided answer is correct as it accurately interprets and matches the final instruction segment.",
