    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: As the agent moves forward over the treeline, the images reveal a cityscape with multiple tall buildings at the edge of the park. The presence of these structures becomes more apparent as the perspective shifts, confirming that there is indeed a tall building (among others) at the edge of the park.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 49)]\nOption: C\nReason: As the agent moves forward and clears the treeline (most notably from 0:25 onwards), the view opens up to reveal a cityscape. This cityscape is characterized by numerous tall buildings that are clearly visible at the edge of the park, forming the urban boundary. While there is a paved area (appearing to be a street or plaza) immediately adjacent to the park's green space, the tall buildings are the most prominent and defining structures that constitute the \"edge\" of the park in relation to the surrounding environment. The provided answer correctly identifies the presence of tall buildings at the edge of the park, which is consistent with the visual evidence.",
