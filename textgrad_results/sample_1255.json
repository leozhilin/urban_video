    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The sequence of images shows an aerial view with the agent flying over various buildings, which aligns with the instruction to \"fly over buildings.\" This is evident from the changing perspectives and the bird's-eye view of the cityscape.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 118), (147, 340), (340, 543)]\nOption: A\nReason: The video begins with an aerial view of a city, showing the agent already flying above buildings (0:00-1:18). After a brief descent and movement at street level (1:19-1:46), the agent clearly \"flies up\" again (starting around 1:47) and continues to move forward with a high, bird's-eye perspective over numerous buildings and roads for the remainder of the video (1:47-5:43). This sustained aerial movement over the cityscape directly corresponds to the instruction \"fly up and move forward and go over the building and road\" and generally aligns with the action \"I fly over buildings.\" Therefore, \"I fly over buildings\" accurately describes the primary action of the agent for a significant portion of the video, especially the latter half. The provided answer's reasoning is correct as the visual evidence strongly supports the agent flying over buildings.",
