At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. What are you doing now?  \nchoose:  \nA. I rise and jump across the roof.  \nB. I move across the water.  \nC. I turn left at the building.  \nD. I turn right at the building.  \nE. I turn back.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The navigation instruction indicates that after moving forward to the blue building and then turning left towards the top, the next step is to slow down to the road and fly along it. The current view shows a turn being made near a building, which aligns with the step of turning left at the building as part of the ongoing navigation sequence.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(3:10, 3:17)]\nOption: C\nReason: The navigation instruction sequence is: \"take off and turn left and turn right move forward to the blue building. now turn left move towards the top and slow down to the road fly along the road. now turn right move towards the building turn left and slow down behind the grey building closely and stay there.\"\nBy the end of the video, the agent has already completed the steps up to \"fly along the road\" (which occurs from approximately 2:00 to 2:50). Following this, the instruction is \"now turn right move towards the building\" (visible from 2:50 to 3:10). The very next instruction is \"turn left\". From 3:10 to 3:17, the video shows the agent actively turning left while flying near buildings. Therefore, the agent is currently performing the \"turn left\" action as instructed. The provided answer's reason incorrectly refers to an earlier \"turn left\" and \"slow down to the road\" instruction; the current \"turn left\" is a later step in the sequence.",
