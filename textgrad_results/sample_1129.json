    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The journey begins with a view of the city from a high vantage point over a park, as seen in the initial frames showing a broad cityscape with trees in the foreground. As the sequence progresses, the perspective moves closer to the buildings and eventually into an apartment, ending at a window with a white curtain on the middle floors of an eight-floor apartment, as depicted in the final frames.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 30), (1:01, 1:02)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video begins with a wide shot of a city skyline seen from a high vantage point, with a large park (trees and a pond) in the foreground, clearly indicating a \"vantage point over the park\" (0:00-0:30). The camera then moves closer to the city buildings (0:30-0:58), eventually zooming into a specific building and focusing on a window. The journey concludes with a close-up view of a window with a white curtain, looking into an interior space, which is consistent with ending at a \"window with a white curtain on the middle floors of an eight-floor apartment\" (1:01-1:02). The provided answer's reasoning is accurate and aligns with the visual evidence in the video.",
