    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The sequence of images shows a progression from an initial position near a river towards and then above the city buildings. The final frames depict a view from a high vantage point, indicating that the agent has flown over the buildings as part of the navigation instructions.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 149)]\nOption: A\nReason: The video starts with the agent at river level, facing the city. The navigation instruction begins with \"take off from the river and turn left towards the city and go straight towards the buildings.\" From approximately 0:11 onwards, the camera clearly shows the agent ascending and moving over the city, with buildings appearing below the viewpoint. The perspective consistently remains high above the ground, looking down at the buildings and streets, indicating a continuous flight over the urban landscape. Therefore, \"I fly over buildings\" accurately describes the primary action the agent is performing throughout the majority of the video after the initial ascent. The provided answer is correct and its reasoning aligns with the visual evidence.",
