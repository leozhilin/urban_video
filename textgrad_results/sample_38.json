    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: The sequence of images shows a progression from an initial position near a river, moving towards and then over buildings in a cityscape. The agent appears to be navigating at a high vantage point, consistent with flying over the buildings as described in the navigation instructions.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 147)]\nOption: A\nReason: The video begins with the agent positioned at a river, looking towards a city skyline. From approximately 0:15 onwards, the camera's perspective clearly shifts to a high vantage point, showing the agent moving above the city's streets, trees, and buildings. This sustained aerial movement over the urban landscape is best described as \"flying over buildings.\" The navigation instruction \"take off from the river and turn left towards the city and go straight towards the buildings\" also supports an aerial progression towards and over the city. The provided answer correctly identifies the primary action depicted in the majority of the video.",
