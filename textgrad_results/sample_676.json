    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The trajectory described in option E matches the visual sequence of the frames. It starts from a scooter lane in a park, turns left to face the street outside the park, rises to the height of a high-rise building across the street, and moves forward to the roof of the high-rise building at the current location outside the edge. This aligns with the observed movement from ground level through the park, ascending above the street, and finally reaching a rooftop vantage point overlooking the area.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 25)]\nOption: E\nReason: From the video, we can see the trajectory starts from the roof of a building, then it shows a park with a scooter lane, and then it rises to the height of a high-rise building across the street. Finally, it moves forward to the roof of the high-rise building at the current location outside the edge. So option E is the correct answer.\n",
