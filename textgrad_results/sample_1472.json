  "question": "Question: You are navigating to the balcony on the 9th floor. What is the correct summary of your trajectory from the beginning to the current location?  \nChoice:  \nA. I start from a high-rise building, descend to street level, and move towards the target building.  \nB. I start from the street, move to the park, rise to the roof of the target building, and then descend to the 9th floor.  \nC. I start from a distance, approach the target building, and land on the balcony on the 9th floor.  \nD. I start from above the high-rise building, move horizontally, and descend to the target building. I am currently hovering near the 9th floor.  \nE. I start from the left side of the building with a huge conical dome, turn right, descend to a certain height, and move forward to approach the balcony on the 9th floor.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The trajectory starts from a high vantage point on the left side of a building with a conical dome, then turns right, descends to a certain height, and moves forward to approach the balcony on the 9th floor, which matches the visual progression in the frames.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 144)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video begins with a wide shot from a high vantage point, showing a city skyline. A tall building with a distinctive conical dome is visible on the right side of the frame (0:00-0:04). The camera then performs a rightward pan, bringing the conical dome building more into the center of the view. Following this, the camera begins a continuous descent, moving downwards along the side of this building (0:05 onwards). As it descends, the camera also moves closer to the building, effectively approaching it. Floor numbers are visible on the building, decreasing from the 30s down to the lower single digits, indicating the descent towards the 9th floor and beyond. This trajectory matches the description in Option E: starting from the left side of the building (relative to the initial view), turning right, descending, and moving forward to approach the target 9th floor. The provided answer's reasoning is accurate and aligns with the visual evidence.",
