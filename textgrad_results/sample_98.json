    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: To navigate to the 28th-floor balcony, the next logical step is to approach the windows on the 28th floor, as they are part of the building's exterior and can lead to the balcony. The other options do not directly relate to reaching a specific floor of the building.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 23)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video shows a tall building with floor numbers clearly marked on its exterior, including the 28th floor (visible from approximately 0:08 onwards). To navigate to the 28th-floor balcony, the most direct and logical next step is to approach the specific part of the building that corresponds to that floor, which includes its windows. The windows on the 28th floor are clearly visible in the video. Options A, B, C, and D are either too general (A, B) or completely irrelevant to reaching a specific floor of a building (C, D). The provided answer correctly identifies that approaching the windows on the 28th floor is the appropriate action.",
