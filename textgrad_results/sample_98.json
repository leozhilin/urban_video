Thinking back on past Action Generations and objects you have seen, what should you approach next in order to get from your current location to your destination?  \nchoose:  \nA. I approach the height of the building at 28 stories.  \nB. I approach the roof height of high-rise buildings.  \nC. I approach the lamppost on the street corner.  \nD. I approach the parking lot across the street.  \nE. I approach the windows on the 28th floor.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: To navigate to the 28th-floor balcony, the next logical step is to approach the windows on the 28th floor, as they are part of the building's exterior and can lead to the balcony. The other options do not directly relate to reaching the specific floor required.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 23)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video shows a tall building with floor numbers clearly marked on its side, ranging from the 24th floor to the 31st floor. The 28th floor is explicitly visible. To navigate to the 28th-floor balcony, the most direct and logical next step is to approach the windows on the 28th floor, as balconies are typically accessed from within the building via windows or doors on that specific floor. Options A and B are too general and do not specify the exact target. Options C and D refer to ground-level objects (lamppost, parking lot) which are irrelevant for reaching a high-floor balcony. The provided answer correctly identifies the windows on the 28th floor as the appropriate next approach.",
