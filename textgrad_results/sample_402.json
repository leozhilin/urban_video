    "init_answer": "Option: A; Reason: To navigate to the 21st-floor balcony, the agent needs to rise vertically since the current perspective is at a lower level and looking up at the building. Rising will bring the agent closer to the target floor.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 27)]\nOption: A\nReason: At the initial position (0:00), the agent's perspective is looking upwards at a tall building, which implies the agent is currently at a lower elevation than the 21st floor. The goal is to navigate to the \"21st-floor balcony\". To reach a higher floor from a lower starting point, the agent needs to move vertically upwards. Therefore, \"I rise\" is the appropriate next move. The subsequent frames (0:05-0:27) show the camera panning down the building, revealing floor numbers, which further confirms the vertical nature of the navigation task. The provided answer is correct and its reasoning aligns with the visual evidence.",
