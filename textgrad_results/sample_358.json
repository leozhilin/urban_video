    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The fountain is located to the left of the current position, and turning right would not lead directly to the fountain. Therefore, the correct action is to turn left towards the fountain.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 8)]\nOption: E\nReason: From the initial position at 00:00, the camera's field of view is centered on the building and the street. As the video progresses from 00:05 to 00:08, the camera pans to the right (indicated by the scene shifting left and new elements appearing from the right side of the frame), revealing the fountain area. This camera movement indicates that the fountain is located to the right of the agent's initial orientation. Therefore, to navigate towards the fountain, the agent's next step should be to turn right. The provided answer correctly selects Option E, but its reasoning is flawed as it incorrectly states the fountain is to the left and then contradicts itself by concluding that turning left is the correct action while choosing Option E (turn right).",
