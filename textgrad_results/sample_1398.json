  "ground_truth": "D",
  "textgrad_result": {
    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The current location is on top of a building, as indicated by the high vantage point overlooking the lake and surrounding structures. This aligns with the instruction mentioning \"going top of the building,\" suggesting that the agent is now positioned above the lake.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(3:45, 6:25)]\nOption: D\nReason: The navigation instructions state \"going top of the building\". The video segments from 3:45 to the end clearly show the agent's perspective from a very high vantage point, looking down over a cityscape and a large body of water (the lake). This high perspective confirms that the agent is currently located on top of a building, which places them physically above the lake. The provided answer correctly identifies this position and links it to the instruction.",
