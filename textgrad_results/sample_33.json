    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The image shows a main pool with an adjacent smaller pool that has a fish theme, which matches the description in option C.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(1:25, 1:49)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video, particularly from 1:25 onwards, shows a large main pool with dolphin mosaics. Immediately adjacent to this main pool, there is a smaller, shallower pool that features fish mosaics on its bottom. This perfectly matches the description in Option C, \"Smaller children's pool with a fish theme.\" The children's playground mentioned in Option A is visible earlier in the video (around 1:00-1:20) but is not immediately adjacent to the pool area. Options B, D, and E are not accurate descriptions of the area immediately next to the main pool.",
