  "question": "Question: Instead of descending toward the building facade (Movement 5), if you choose to fly around the building, can you still locate the back door with the green trash can?  \nChoices:  \nA. I can complete the task because it provides a different vantage point, but the alternative takes longer.  \nB. I cannot complete the task because the back door is not visible from that path.  \nC. I can complete the task because I follow an open path, taking the same time.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The back door with the green trash can is not visible from the path around the building, as the current trajectory and frames provided do not show this specific feature from an alternative route.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 45)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video shows the agent descending towards the building facade. The question asks if flying *around* the building would allow the agent to locate the back door with the green trash can. The video does not show the view from around the building, so it's impossible to know if the back door is visible from that path. Therefore, I cannot complete the task because the back door is not visible from that path. The provided answer is correct.\n",
