    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The last frame of the video shows a close-up view of a helipad, and there is no indication of the center of the tarmac within the field of view. The focus is entirely on the helipad marking, suggesting that the destination (center of the tarmac) is not visible from this perspective.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 20)]\nOption: D\nReason: The video shows a first-person view approaching a helipad. The question asks if the center of the *tarmac* is visible in the last frame. The last few frames of the video focus entirely on the helipad, and the tarmac is not visible. Therefore, the destination is not within view. The provided answer is correct.\n",
