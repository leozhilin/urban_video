    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current view shows the agent flying through a tree-lined area with a visible fountain, which aligns with the instruction to \"fly over the trees and decrease altitude at the fountain.\" This matches option B.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(2:15, 2:30)]\nOption: B\nReason: The navigation instruction states: \"fly over the trees and decrease altitude at the fountain.\" In the video segment from approximately 2:15 to 2:30, the agent is seen flying over a dense area of trees, and as the camera descends, a fountain becomes clearly visible in the foreground. This visual evidence directly corresponds to the instruction \"fly over the trees and decrease altitude at the fountain,\" which is accurately described by option B. The provided answer is correct.",
