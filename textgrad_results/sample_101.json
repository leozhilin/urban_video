  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [rise, turn around, and fly to the red rockets billboard. turn to the right and fly to the stone building with the coca cola bottle billboard. turn to the right and fly to the daves car wash billboard. turn to the left and fly to the last building on the street that has a door on the roof.]. At the initial position, you are asked to move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is your best next step?  \nchoose:  \nA. I fly forward, then turn left.  \nB. I drop down and turn left.  \nC. I fly forward while rising.  \nD. I turn left and descend.  \nE. I rotate the camera downward.  ",

  "textgrad_result": {
    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The navigation instruction starts with \"rise,\" which indicates that the first action should be to increase altitude. Therefore, flying forward while rising aligns with the initial step of the given instructions.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15)]\nOption: C\nReason: The first instruction given is \"rise\". The video immediately shows the agent rising from behind the trees (0:00-0:15) to reveal the city skyline. While rising, the agent also appears to be moving slightly forward to clear the immediate foreground and gain a better view of the environment. Therefore, \"I fly forward while rising\" is the most accurate description of the initial combined movement that aligns with the first instruction and the visual evidence. The provided answer's reasoning is correct as \"rise\" is the primary initial action, and combining it with \"fly forward\" is a natural way to execute it in this context.",
