    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"rise, turn around, and fly to the red rockets billboard.\" Given the current perspective, which appears to be at a lower altitude among trees, the best next step is to rise and gain a better vantage point to locate the red rockets billboard. Therefore, flying forward while rising aligns with the first part of the navigation instruction.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15)]\nOption: C\nReason: The initial navigation instruction is to \"[rise, turn around, and fly to the red rockets billboard]\". At the initial position (0:00), the agent is at a low altitude, surrounded by trees, with the city skyline partially visible in the distance. To locate and fly to the \"red rockets billboard\" in the city, the agent must first gain altitude to get a clear view. The video from 0:00 to 0:15 clearly shows the agent rising and simultaneously moving forward, clearing the trees and revealing the city. This combined action of \"flying forward while rising\" directly addresses the \"rise\" part of the instruction and is a necessary initial step to effectively \"fly to the red rockets billboard.\" Options A, B, D, and E do not align with the primary need to rise or contradict the instruction. The provided answer correctly identifies that rising is crucial for a better vantage point and that \"flying forward while rising\" is the best next step to initiate the navigation.",
