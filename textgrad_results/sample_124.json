    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: To navigate to the 17th floor balcony, the first step is to approach the entrance to the building. This allows access inside where you can use the elevator or stairs to reach the 17th floor and then find the balcony.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 57)]\nOption: C\nReason: The question asks for the next step to navigate to the 17th floor balcony from the initial position. The video starts with a high-level view of a city, then pans down to show a tall building with floor numbers clearly marked. The 17th floor is visible on this building. To reach a specific floor within a building, the most logical and necessary first step is to gain entry into the building itself. Approaching the entrance allows access to internal mechanisms like elevators or stairs, which are required to ascend to the 17th floor. Options A, B, D, and E are either too general (A), irrelevant (B, E), or describe the destination rather than the immediate next action (D). The provided answer correctly identifies approaching the building's entrance as the crucial first step in this high-level navigation task.",
