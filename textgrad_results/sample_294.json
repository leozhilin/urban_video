You move according to a series of movement instructions. What are you doing now?  \nchoose:  \nA. I look around the square area.  \nB. I turn left and land on the roof of the building on the left.  \nC. I turn to the side of the road.  \nD. I land on the roof of the building on the right.  \nE. I fly through the trees.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The sequence of images shows that the agent has moved from observing the square area and flying towards the highway. The current view indicates that the agent is now turning left and approaching the roof of a building on the left, as instructed in the navigation command.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0:57, 1:14)]\nOption: B\nReason: The navigation instruction outlines three sequential steps: \"[Observe around the square area, then fly towards the highway, then turn left and land on the roof of the building on the left]\".\nIn the initial frames (approximately 0:00-0:10), the agent is seen observing the surrounding area from a high vantage point, fulfilling the first instruction.\nFrom roughly 0:10 to 0:57, the agent moves forward and descends, flying over buildings and approaching a main road/highway, which becomes clearly visible in the latter part of this segment (e.g., 0:50-0:57), indicating the execution of the \"fly towards the highway\" instruction.\nFrom 0:57 onwards, the agent initiates a distinct left turn. By 1:05, a large building is clearly visible on the left side of the frame, and the agent continues to adjust its trajectory, consistent with the final instruction to \"turn left and land on the roof of the building on the left\". Therefore, at the current point in the video (the end of the clip), the agent is actively engaged in turning left and approaching the designated landing spot on the roof of the building on the left. The provided answer correctly identifies this progress.",
