    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The journey starts between tall buildings, as seen in the initial frames where the perspective is from a high vantage point looking down a narrow street flanked by skyscrapers. It ends at the balcony on the 22nd floor of a building, which is evident from the final frames showing a close-up view of the building's exterior with visible floor numbers up to the 22nd floor and a balcony.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1), (49, 51)]\nOption: C\nReason: The journey begins with a view from a high vantage point, looking down a street that is clearly flanked by multiple tall buildings or skyscrapers, indicating a start \"between tall buildings\" (0:00-0:01). The journey concludes as the camera descends along the side of a building, stopping at a level where the number \"22\" is prominently displayed next to a window, and a balcony railing is visible, confirming the end point is \"at the balcony on the 22nd floor\" (0:49-0:51). The provided answer correctly identifies both the starting and ending points based on the visual evidence.",
