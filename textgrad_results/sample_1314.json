    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The initial instruction is to \"take off from the terrace and show the loan signage and turn left show the bridge and sea view.\" Given the current perspective, which appears to be at a lower altitude near the bridge and sea view, the best next step is to turn left and go up to align with the instruction to show the bridge and sea view effectively. This matches option E, which involves turning left and ascending.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1)]\nOption: E\nReason: The initial instruction is to \"take off from the terrace and show the loan signage and turn left show the bridge and sea view.\" At the initial position (00:00), the agent is at a relatively low altitude, with the bridge visible on the left and the sea view ahead. To \"take off from the terrace\" implies an upward movement. To \"turn left show the bridge and sea view\" implies a left turn to better frame or emphasize the bridge and sea. Therefore, the best next step is to combine these actions: turn left and go up. This aligns perfectly with option E. The provided answer's reasoning is correct.",
