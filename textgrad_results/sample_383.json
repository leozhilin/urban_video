    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The agent has moved to the top of the adjacent hill, which places it above the modern glass-walled office building. The perspective in the images shows a downward view towards the building, indicating that the agent is now at a higher elevation than the building.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 59)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video shows the agent moving towards the modern glass walled office building and then ascending to a higher altitude. From 0:04 to 0:59, the camera is positioned above the building, looking down. This indicates that the agent is located above the modern glass walled office building.
