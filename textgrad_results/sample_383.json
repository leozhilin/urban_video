    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The agent has moved to the top of the adjacent hill, which places it above the modern glass-walled office building. The perspective in the images shows a downward view of the building, indicating that the agent is now at a higher elevation relative to the building.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 105)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video begins with a close-up of a rooftop, then pans up and out to reveal a city landscape. A tall, modern glass-walled office building is visible in the distance from approximately 0:04 onwards. The instructions state to \"Move towards a modern glass walled office building nearby. Then fly to the top of the adjacent hill\". As the video progresses, particularly from 0:10 to the end, the camera (representing the agent's perspective) steadily gains altitude. By the latter half of the video (e.g., 0:40-1:05), the agent is clearly at a very high elevation, looking down upon the entire city, including the modern glass-walled office building, which appears significantly below. This downward perspective confirms that the agent is located above the building, consistent with having flown to the top of an adjacent hill or a high vantage point. The provided answer correctly identifies this positional relationship.",
