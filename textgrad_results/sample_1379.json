    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The current view shows an aerial perspective flying over a dense area of trees, which aligns with the instruction \"fly over third row of trees.\" This indicates that the agent is currently executing this part of the navigation instructions.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(2, 01, 2, 35)]\nOption: E\nReason: The navigation instructions are a sequence of actions. By observing the video, the agent progresses through several steps. Initially, the agent is in a park-like setting, then flies low near a shed (around 0:20-0:26), then moves along a lake (around 0:53-1:42). The final instruction in the list is \"fly over third row of trees.\" From approximately 2:01 to the end of the video, the agent is clearly shown flying at a significant altitude over a vast expanse of trees, indicating that this is the current action being performed. The provided answer correctly identifies this.",
