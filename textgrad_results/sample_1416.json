  "question": "Question: Does it take you longer to fly parallel to the boulevard or to fly over the treetops?  \nChoice: A. My flight time is longer parallel to the boulevard than it is above the treetops.  \n           B. I fly parallel to the boulevard for less time than I fly above the treetops.  \n           C. I fly parallel to the boulevard for the same amount of time as I fly over the treetops.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The sequence of images shows that the agent spends more frames (and thus time) flying over the treetops compared to flying parallel to the boulevard. The transition from urban buildings to a view dominated by trees and greenery indicates a longer duration spent above the treetops.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 17), (18, 110)]\nOption: B\nReason: The video begins with the agent flying alongside buildings and a boulevard. This phase, where the agent flies parallel to the boulevard, lasts from approximately 0:00 to 0:17. From around 0:18 onwards, the agent's perspective shifts to flying directly over a large expanse of trees and a park, eventually revealing a lake. This \"flying over the treetops\" phase continues until the end of the video at 1:10. By comparing the durations, 17 seconds for flying parallel to the boulevard is significantly less than 52 seconds (1:10 - 0:18) for flying over the treetops. Therefore, it takes longer to fly over the treetops.\n\nThe provided answer (Option B) is correct. The reasoning accurately identifies that the agent spends more time flying over the treetops, which is supported by the visual evidence and the duration of each segment in the video.",
