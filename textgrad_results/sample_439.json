    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The gazebo next to a pond is not visible within the current field of view. The frames show a high-angle view of a residential area with tall buildings and a pond, but the specific gazebo mentioned is not in sight.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 7)]\nOption: C\nReason: At the initial position (00:00), the video displays a top-down view of a paved pathway and surrounding green spaces. The pond and any structures like a gazebo next to it are not visible within this initial field of view. The camera begins to pan upwards and reveal the pond and gazebos only from approximately 00:07 onwards. Therefore, at the current location (initial position), the destination is not within sight. The provided reason's description of \"The frames show a high-angle view of a residential area with tall buildings and a pond\" is inaccurate for the initial frames (00:00-00:06), as these elements are not yet visible.",
