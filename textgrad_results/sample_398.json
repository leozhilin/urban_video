  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [takeoff from the white statue located in the park and turn left to the city show lamp post and signal and show butcher signage. fly high through the eds butcher shop signage and show pathway with signal lamp post. turn right and move towards high building and show fire exit of building and turn left to the lamp post street view.]. You move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of the next steps, what is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I go up and turn left.  \nB. I descend and then fly forward.  \nC. I fly forward while rotating the camera upward.  \nD. I turn right and go up.  \nE. I rotate the camera down, then left.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The agent has already navigated through the cityscape and is now likely at a higher vantage point given the previous instructions to \"fly high.\" The next logical step, according to the navigation instruction which mentions moving towards a high building and showing a fire exit, would be to descend and then fly forward to get closer to the specific building details like the fire exit. This aligns with option B, which suggests descending and then flying forward.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(2:58, 3:04)]\nOption: B\nReason: The navigation instruction states: \"...show fire exit of building and turn left to the lamp post street view.\" At the end of the video (around 2:58-3:04), the agent has just completed showing the fire exit of a building, which is viewed from a high vantage point. The next instruction is to \"turn left to the lamp post street view.\" To transition from a high-altitude view of a building's side to a \"street view,\" the agent must first descend. Option B, \"I descend and then fly forward,\" is the only choice that includes the essential \"descend\" action. While it doesn't explicitly state \"turn left,\" descending is the critical first step to reach street level, and flying forward could then position the agent for the subsequent left turn to achieve the desired street view. The provided answer's reason incorrectly states that the purpose of the next step is \"to get closer to the specific building details like the fire exit\"; showing the fire exit is the *completed* part of the instruction, not the next action. The actual next goal is to obtain a \"lamp post street view.\"",
