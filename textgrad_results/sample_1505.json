    "init_answer": "Option: D; Reason: The initial position shows a view of tall buildings and a cityscape, but there is no visible balcony on the 22nd floor within the field of view. The perspective does not include close-up details of specific floors or balconies.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 1)]\nOption: D\nReason: At the initial position (00:00), the video displays a wide view of a cityscape with several tall buildings. From this high and distant vantage point, it is impossible to discern individual floors or specific balconies on any of the buildings, including the 22nd floor. The camera's field of view at this initial moment does not provide the necessary detail to identify such a specific feature. The provided answer is consistent with this observation.",
