At the initial position, you are asked to navigate according to a series of movement instructions. When you reach the current location, what is the Landmark Position to the blue three-story building?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am on the right side of the blue three-story building.  \nB. I am located above the blue three-story building.  \nC. I am on the left side of the blue three-story building.  \nD. I am located behind the blue three-story building.  \nE. I am far away from the blue three-story building.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The current location, as depicted in the images, shows a view of the city with multiple buildings but does not specifically indicate proximity to a blue three-story building. The environment suggests a broader urban landscape rather than a specific focus on the mentioned building, implying that the agent is far away from it.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(21, 32)]\nOption: [C]\nReason: From 21s to 32s, the blue three-story building is visible. The camera is positioned to the left of the building.",
    "feedback": "### Structured Analysis\n\n#### 1. Key Disagreements\n\n##### 1.1 Proximity to the Blue Three-Story Building\n- **Original Answer Viewpoint**: The agent is far away from the blue three-story building (Option E).\n- **Evaluation Viewpoint**: The agent is on the left side of the blue three-story building (Option C).\n\n  - **Visual Evidence Support**:\n    - **Original Answer**: The answer suggests a broader urban landscape without specific focus, implying distance. However, this is not supported by concrete visual evidence in the provided context.\n    - **Evaluation**: The evaluation references a specific timeframe (21s to 32s) where the blue three-story building is visible, and the camera is positioned to the left of it. This claim is based on visual evidence but needs confirmation.\n\n##### 1.2 Specific Position Relative to the Building\n- **Original Answer Viewpoint**: No specific position relative to the building is identified; the agent is generally far away.\n- **Evaluation Viewpoint**: The agent is specifically on the left side of the building.\n\n  - **Visual Evidence Support**:\n    - **Original Answer**: Lacks specific visual evidence to support the exact position relative to the building.\n    - **Evaluation**: Claims the agent is on the left side based on visual evidence from 21s to 32s. This requires verification to confirm the exact positioning.\n\n#### 2. Required Verifications\n\n##### 2.1 Verification of Proximity\n- **Specific Visual Evidence Needed**: \n  - Re-examine frames from 21s to 32s to confirm the presence and proximity of the blue three-story building.\n  - Compare the scale and details of the building in these frames with the surrounding environment to assess actual distance.\n\n##### 2.2 Verification of Specific Position (Left Side)\n- **Additional Frames or Perspectives**:\n  - Obtain frames showing the front, right side, and back of the blue three-story building for comparison.\n  - Analyze the angle and perspective of the camera in relation to the building's features (e.g., windows, doors) to determine the exact side.\n\n##### 2.3 Type of Visual Information Needed\n- **Proximity**: Clear, close-up views of the building and surrounding landmarks to judge distance.\n- **Position**: Multiple angles (front, sides, back) to accurately determine the agent's position relative to the building.\n\n#### 3. Resolution Path\n\n##### 3.1 Steps to Resolve Each Disagreement\n1. **Re-examine Frames (21s to 32s)**: Carefully analyze these frames for the blue three-story building's presence and proximity.\n2. **Compare with Surrounding Landmarks**: Use other visible landmarks to gauge the actual distance from the building.\n3. **Analyze Camera Angle**: Determine the exact side of the building the agent is on by comparing with multiple angles.\n\n##### 3.2 Prioritize Verifications\n- **Proximity Verification**: Most critical as it directly impacts the choice between \"far away\" (E) and \"on the left side\" (C).\n- **Position Verification**: Important for confirming the exact side if proximity is confirmed.\n\n##### 3.3 Additional Evidence Needed\n- **Close-up Views**: To confirm proximity.\n- **Multiple Angles**: To confirm the exact side (front, right, back for comparison).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe key disagreements center around the agent's proximity and specific position relative to the blue three-story building. Resolving these requires a detailed re-examination of the relevant frames and additional visual evidence from multiple angles. Prioritizing the verification of proximity is crucial, followed by confirming the exact position. This structured approach will help achieve an accurate and evidence-based resolution.",
    "final_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The current location, as depicted in the images from 21s to 32s, shows the agent positioned to the left side of the blue three-story building. The camera angle and surrounding environment confirm this positioning, indicating that the agent is on the left side of the building."
