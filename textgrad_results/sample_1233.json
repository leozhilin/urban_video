  "question": "Question: Instead of flying directly over the lake towards the main street, if you choose to take a detour around the lake, can you complete the task, and how is the alternative route?  \nChoices:  \nA. I can complete the task by taking a detour around the lake because it offers a clearer view, and the alternative takes less time.  \nB. I cannot complete the task by taking a detour around the lake because it deviates from the intended path.  \nC. I can complete the task by taking a detour around the lake because I can still avoid possible obstacles with enough height, but the alternative takes longer.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: Taking a detour around the lake is feasible as it allows for the avoidance of potential obstacles such as trees and other environmental features. Although this route is longer than flying directly over the lake, it ensures a safer path to the main street, thereby completing the task effectively.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 40)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video shows a lake with trees surrounding it and a main street beyond. Taking a detour around the lake instead of flying directly over it is feasible, as the environment appears traversable for a flying agent. By definition, a detour implies a longer path than a direct route, so the alternative route would indeed take longer. For a flying agent, obstacles like trees can generally be avoided by adjusting altitude, which supports the idea that the task can still be completed even with a detour. The provided answer's reasoning aligns with this, stating the route is feasible, allows for obstacle avoidance (by height), and takes longer. Therefore, the provided answer is consistent with my analysis.",
