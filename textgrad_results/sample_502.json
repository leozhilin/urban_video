  "textgrad_result": {
    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current location is above the EDS butcher shop as indicated by the navigation instructions which mention \"fly near the eds butcher shop and fly upwards and again take a turn.\" This suggests that the agent has already passed the EDS butcher shop and is now at a higher altitude, thus being above it.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(51, 51), (512, 515)]\nOption: [B]\nReason: The navigation instructions state \"fly near the eds butcher shop and fly upwards and again take a turn\". The video shows the agent flying upwards after reaching the lake. Therefore, the agent is located above the EDS butcher shop.",
    "feedback": null,
    "final_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current location is above the EDS butcher shop as indicated by the navigation instructions which mention \"fly near the eds butcher shop and fly upwards and again take a turn.\" This suggests that the agent has already passed the EDS butcher shop and is now at a higher altitude, thus being above it."
