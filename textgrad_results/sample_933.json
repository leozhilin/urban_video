  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [zoom in on the left tower. resume flying over green bush. turn left at grey building. reverse backwards to the green bush. turn left and zoom in on satellite dish. resume flying over the city buildings. stop and turn left. zoom in on red bulletin board. go to ground level of grey building. turn left at the brown sandstone house. zoom in on ord window of the blue building.]. You move according to a series of movement instructions. In terms of next steps, what is the best next step for you?  \nchoose:  \nA. I turn left and go up.  \nB. I descend and fly forward.  \nC. I rotate the camera downward and fly forward.  \nD. I turn right and rotate the camera upward.  \nE. I fly forward as I rise.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The next step in the navigation instruction is to \"resume flying over the city buildings,\" which implies continuing forward movement at a consistent altitude. Option B, \"I descend and fly forward,\" aligns with this as it involves moving forward, though it also includes descending, which might be necessary to navigate through or closer to the buildings. This option seems most appropriate given the context of resuming flight over the cityscape.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15), (30, 46)]\nOption: B\nReason: The instruction is to \"resume flying over the city buildings\". From the video, we can see that the agent is currently at a high altitude. To fly over the city buildings, the agent needs to descend and fly forward. Therefore, the best next step is to descend and fly forward.",
