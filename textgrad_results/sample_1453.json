    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 119)]\nOption: A\nReason: The video begins with an aerial view (0:00-0:03) showing the agent positioned above a road with a sidewalk, surrounded by high-rise residential buildings. The camera then moves forward and slightly to the right (0:03-0:13), descending towards a square featuring a fountain. Following this, the agent continues to descend, passing over the roof of a building adjacent to the square (0:13-0:18). Finally, the descent continues directly towards and over the pond and rockery, providing a close-up view of these features (0:18-1:19). This sequence of movements precisely matches the description in Option A. The provided answer is correct.",
