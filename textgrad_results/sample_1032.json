  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [Passing through several buildings in front of agent, see a lake and fly over the bridge in the middle of the lake]. At the initial position, you are asked to navigate according to a series of movement instructions. What are you doing now?  \nchoose:  \nA. I fly over the bridge in the middle of the lake.  \nB. I go to the chair between the buildings.  \nC. I go through several buildings in front of me.  \nD. I see a lake.  \nE. I turn right at the building.  ",

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The agent is currently navigating through several buildings, as indicated by the close proximity and alignment of the high-rise structures in the frames. This matches the initial navigation instruction to \"pass through several buildings in front of the agent.\" The other options do not align with the current visual context provided by the frames.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 44)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video starts with the agent positioned among and moving towards a cluster of tall buildings. As the video progresses, the agent continues to move forward, with the buildings framing the view, indicating that the agent is actively \"passing through\" these structures. This directly aligns with the first part of the given navigation instruction: \"Passing through several buildings in front of agent.\" While a lake becomes visible in the distance later in the video (around 0:20), the primary action depicted throughout the video, especially in the initial and middle segments, is the traversal of the building area. The other options describe actions not yet occurring (flying over a bridge) or not mentioned in the instructions (going to a chair, turning right). Therefore, the provided answer is correct.",
