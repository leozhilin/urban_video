  "question": "Question: Navigation Instruction given at initial position: [Take off, rise, and go left over the flat roof. Fly straight to the building with a lady on a billboard, then veer right and continue straight. Head to the yellow billboard, make a half right turn, and fly over the fountain towards the trees. Fly over the treetops, veer right towards the road between buildings, then take a near full left turn over trees until you see water. Rise near a tree, turn right until you see four buildings, then go straight to the car banner. Fly between the banner and building, continue straight, veer left of the high-rise, then a bit right. Descend to see a 5-story building, turn left, rise above it, and make a half left turn. Fly right of the car banner building to see the skyline, then turn left slightly and fly high over the trees.]. You move according to a series of movement instructions. What are you doing now?  \nchoose:  \nA. I fly over the treetops, then turn right onto a road with buildings on either side.  \nB. I go directly between the banner and the building it will be on top of.  \nC. I am flying over the treetops.  \nD. I point down until I see the front of a 5-story building.  \nE.

    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The current view shows a broad perspective of the cityscape with buildings and trees, indicating that the agent has completed the previous instructions involving flying over specific landmarks and is now in a phase where they are maintaining a general forward trajectory with a slight left turn as described in the navigation instruction. This aligns with the option \"I turn slightly left and go straight.\"",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15), (27, 33), (40, 50)]\nOption: E\nReason: From the beginning of the video to 15 seconds, the agent is flying straight with a slight left turn. From 27 to 33 seconds, the agent is flying straight with a slight left turn. From 40 to 50 seconds, the agent is flying straight with a slight left turn. Therefore, the answer is E.\n\n",
