    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 4)]\nOption: C\nReason: At the initial position (frames 00:00-00:04), the tables and chairs in front of the Central ALL-STAR Cafe are not visible within the field of view. The scene shows a wide city street with multiple buildings and trees. On the left side of the field of view, a very prominent and tall high-rise building is clearly visible across the street. The lower part of this building, where its main entrance would be, is within the view. This aligns perfectly with option C, which states that the tables and chairs are not visible, but the main entrance of a high-rise building across the street is on the left side of the field of view. Options A, D, and E describe objects not clearly present or less prominent than the high-rise building, and option B is incorrect as the target objects are not visible. The provided answer correctly identifies the high-rise building on the left as the most relevant object.",
