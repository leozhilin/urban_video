I am currently above the park and across the street from the store.  \nB. I am currently directly above the store.  \nC. I am currently on the other side of the street, further away from the store.  \nD. I am currently in the middle of the street, moving toward the store.  \nE.

    "init_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The current perspective shows that the agent is on the other side of the street relative to the store with the green sign \"\u6854\u5b50\u751f\u9c9cs,\" and it appears further away, indicating that the agent needs to cross the street and move towards the store.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 9)]\nOption: C\nReason: The video starts with a high aerial view and gradually zooms in, revealing more details of the city environment. At the final frames (00:08-00:09), the camera is positioned high above a street. On the right side of this street, a building with a prominent green sign that reads \"\u6854\u5b50\u751f\u9c9cs\" is clearly visible. This is the destination. The agent's perspective (the camera's viewpoint) is from the left side of the street, looking across towards the store. Therefore, the agent is currently on the \"other side of the street\" relative to the store. Furthermore, the agent is at a significant elevation, looking down, which implies being \"further away\" in terms of needing to descend and cross the street to reach the ground-level store. The provided answer's reasoning accurately describes this spatial relationship.",
