  "ground_truth": "B",
  "textgrad_result": {
    "init_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The current view shows a high vantage point above the buildings, indicating that the agent is flying over them. The beige building is visible below, suggesting that the agent is located above it.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 15), (115, 145), (250, 260)]\nOption: [B]\nReason: From the beginning of the video to 15s, the camera is at a low position. From 115s to 145s, the camera is at a high position, and the beige building is below the camera. From 250s to 260s, the camera is at a high position, and the beige building is below the camera. So the answer is B. I am located above the beige building.",
