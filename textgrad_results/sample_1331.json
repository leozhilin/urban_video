    "init_answer": "Option: E; Reason: The current location shows a gray apartment building directly in front, with a school featuring a runway and several smaller buildings visible in the background. This matches the description in option E.",
    "evaluation": "Location: [(0, 53)]\nOption: E\nReason: The video begins with a close-up view of a tall, gray apartment building, which is the most prominent structure directly in front of the camera's initial perspective (0:00-0:10). As the camera pans down and then to the left (0:10-0:53), a school complex becomes visible. This complex includes a running track (referred to as a \"runway\" in the option, which is a common term for a track in this context) and several smaller buildings, including a distinct red one and other white/beige buildings, situated beyond the parking lot and to the left of the gray apartment building. This visual evidence directly supports the description in Option E. The provided answer correctly identifies these key features and their relative positions.",
